# E-64 — Our 37M models vs Laya & Jev on shared published benchmarks (2026-09-22)

**Question (user):** get the eval data that has been evaluated on both Laya and Jev with
their published results, evaluate our model on the same data (never expose/train on it),
and compare.

**Models evaluated (all 37.16M, MiniLM-L12-H384 + decision head):**
- `l1_final` — E-62, typed-decisions fine-tune only.
- `l2_stageA` — E-63 stage A exit (mixture pretrain, 74,427 items, 7 sources).
- `l2_final` — E-63 stage B (mixture pretrain → typed fine-tune).

**Zero-shot guarantee:** PhishNChips, AG News, emotion appear in NO training set (mixture
sources: boolq, squad_v2, snli, mnli, anli, scitail, yelp5; typed-decisions train only for
the typed fine-tunes — the same allowance Laya-typed-decisions used). Test splits never
trained on. PhishNChips protocol replicated verbatim from Luni's bench_platt.py (same
question wording, `rng(0)` split-half Platt, AUROC on the test half).

## Qualifying benchmarks (published numbers for BOTH Laya and Jev + public data)

| Benchmark | Jev (published) | Laya (published) | Ours L1 | Ours stage A | Ours L2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| typed-decisions test acc (400 cases / 2000 decisions) | 0.727 | 0.766 FT · 0.360 base | 0.6205 | — | **0.6585** |
| PhishNChips raw acc (test half) | 0.626 | 0.505 | 0.498 | 0.502 | 0.428 |
| PhishNChips Platt acc (fit on cal half) | (raw only) | 0.611 | 0.442 | 0.559 | 0.585* |
| PhishNChips AUROC (test half) | 0.689 | 0.678 | 0.446 | **0.576** | 0.360* |
| AG News test acc | 0.910 | 0.950/0.930/0.953 | 0.4225 | 0.232 | 0.2685 |
| dair-ai/emotion test acc | 0.480 | 0.595/0.530/0.600 | 0.291 | 0.329 | 0.3655 |
| probe suite (11 assertions, lower failures better) | never probed | 7 base · 4 FT · 1-2 grounded | **1** | 8 | 3 |

\* l2_final's Platt fit produced a<0 (inverted ranking) yet 0.585 on the test half — the
calibration half flipped the boundary and it generalized, but AUROC 0.360 shows the
underlying ranking is anti-correlated. Treat raw + AUROC as primary for l2_final.

## NOT qualifying (recorded honestly)
- **banking77** (Jev 0.870 vs Laya 0.492): both published, but 77 options exceed our
  512-token packing window → non-comparable under truncation. SKIPPED.
- **mayafree typed-decision-leaderboard** (Jev 0.7350 vs Laya-TD 0.5144 AUC, 2018 items):
  raw eval items are private (license) — not runnable by anyone outside.
- **nibzard DMB** (Jev 76.3% banking77 / 93.0% spam): harness public but no Laya numbers.
- **"Jev Decision Index"** (132,422 requests / Jevfire 55.74 / Laya 16.39): no public
  artifact found anywhere (HF/API searches empty) — treated as unverifiable.
- **AG News / emotion caveat:** vendor prompts and sample sizes were not published; their
  numbers are task-adapted, ours are strictly zero-shot — approximate comparison, and it
  is stated as such.

## Verdict (honest, against the goal "beat both Laya and Jev")

**Not achieved on any published benchmark.** On the one protocol-identical comparison
(typed-decisions test, where both published numbers come from models fine-tuned on the
same train split we used), our L2 reaches **0.6585 vs Jev 0.727 (−6.9) and Laya-FT 0.766
(−10.8)**, and stays under the teacher self-agreement ceiling (0.735). On transfer
benchmarks (phishing, AG News, emotion) our zero-shot 37M is at or near chance where both
published models score well — expected: those numbers rest on 421M-scale pretraining
(Laya) or a closed general model (Jev), while our encoders only saw ~74k mixture items.

**What DID work (E-63 gates):**
- **G2 typed acc 0.6585 ≥ 0.60 PASS** — and **+3.8 points over E-62's direct fine-tune**
  (0.6205): the Laya-style mixture-pretrain → typed-fine-tune ladder is the real lever.
  Better soft-acc (0.509 vs 0.489) and Brier (0.139 vs 0.147) too, at identical 37.16M
  params and ~36 min total on an 8 GB card (peak 1,670 MiB).
- **G1 as implemented: FAIL (0.6856 < 0.74)** — but the failure mode is specific: at
  stage-A exit the mixture macro was **0.7478 (over the bar)**; stage B then forgot part
  of it (yelp5 0.512 → 0.22, ANLI 0.744 → 0.674). Classic catastrophic forgetting, not a
  pretraining shortfall.
- **G3 permutation-invariance FAIL for both our models (0.385 L2 / 0.325 L1 ≪ 0.95)** —
  option-rename sensitivity is a real weakness of the current head; fix belongs in
  training-time augmentation, not more probing.
- Calibration: one global T on typed train made ECE worse (0.0888 → 0.1282, T=1.08) —
  model is already near-calibrated on typed data; E-62's lesson reconfirmed.
- **Probe suite: L1 = 1 failure — ties Luni's best grounded arm (Arm A, 1) and beats Laya
  base (7) and Laya-FT (4).** L2 final = 3 (also beats Laya-FT). Our confidence numbers
  use max option probability (no trained confidence head) — noted.

## L3 implications (deferred per user decision)
The ladder works (+3.8) but 37M + 74k mixture cannot close a 6.9-point gap to a closed
general model. The evidence-backed levers, in expected-value order:
1. **Encoder pretraining** (L3 proper): a domain-matched pretrained encoder is where
   Laya's transfer ability comes from — our frozen-ish MiniLM caps zero-shot at chance.
2. **Anti-forgetting rehearsal** in stage B (replay 10-20% mixture) to keep G1 at 0.74+.
3. **Option-rename augmentation** for permutation robustness (G3 0.39 → target 0.95).
4. A 149M ModernBERT-base encoder was already shown at 0.646 (E-62 card) — a mid-rung
   option between 37M and a from-scratch pretrain.

## E-65 addendum: L3 row (from-scratch 35.1M domain-pretrained, 2026-09-23)
| Benchmark (protocol identical) | Laya | Jev | L1 | L2 | **L3** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| typed-decisions test acc | 0.766 (FT) / 0.360 (base) | 0.727 | 0.6205 | 0.6585 | **0.5185** |
| PhishNChips AUROC (Luni protocol) | 0.678 | 0.689 | 0.576 | - | **0.6490** |
| PhishNChips raw acc (test half) | 0.505 | 0.626 | ~0.50 | - | **0.520** |
| AG News (approx comparison) | 0.950/0.930/0.953 | 0.910 | 0.23-0.42 | - | **0.245 (4-way chance)** |
| emotion (approx comparison) | 0.595/0.530/0.600 | 0.480 | 0.29-0.37 | - | **0.315** |
| probe failures (11 assertions) | 7 / 4 (base/FT) | n/a | **1** | 3 | 2 |

Reading: domain pretraining moved the PHISHING transfer gate over the bar for the first
time (0.576 -> 0.649, within 0.03-0.04 of Laya/Jev) but widened the decision-benchmark
gap - 260M domain tokens cannot substitute for ~1B general pretraining tokens at this
scale. Replay held retention perfectly this time (stage-A exit 0.6625 -> post-B 0.6622,
-0.0003): the G1 failure is a low ceiling, not forgetting. Order-shuffle + rename
augmentation did NOT fix permutation invariance (0.185, worse than unaugmented 0.385).


## E-66 addendum row (2026-09-23): L3 + perm-duplicate (E-66)
| Benchmark | L3 (E-65) | **L3-e66 (E-66)** | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| typed-decisions test acc | 0.5185 | **0.5630** | +4.45 - best single-lever gain so far |
| perm agreement | 0.1850 | **0.2150** | training-side invariance FAILED to fix G3 (2nd attack) |
| PhishNChips AUROC | 0.6490 | **0.6086** | held over the 0.60 bar (epoch-noisy) |
| Brier | 0.1728 | **0.1637** | calibration improved |
| probe failures | 2 | **4** | regression - confidence assertions broke |
| AG News / emotion | 0.245 / 0.315 | **0.2435 / 0.245** | unchanged (chance) |

Conclusion: accuracy and calibration moved, order-invariance did not - two training-side attacks exhausted; E-67 (eval-side calibration, pre-registered) is the remaining G3 route.

## E-69 addendum row (2026-09-23): L3 + KD distillation (E-69)
| Metric | L3-e68 (best) | **L3-e69** | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| typed test acc | 0.6530 | **0.5490** | KD at w=0.5 HURTS (-1.4 vs same-recipe E-66) |
| Brier | 0.1382 | **0.1680** | worse |
| probe failures | 2 | **4** | regression returned at 4-epoch length |
| PhishNChips AUROC | 0.5878 | **0.6098** | over the 0.60 bar (epoch-noisy) |
| AG News / emotion | 0.272 / 0.306 | **0.245 / 0.215** | transfer loss |
Conclusion: teacher soft targets do not transfer the teacher's advantage - its value is the pretrainedencoder weights, not the decision function. Distillation closed as a negative at this config; the from-scratch 35M encoder line reached 0.6530 by recipe (length) alone.

## E-70 addendum row (2026-09-23): L3 + 520M-token encoder (double-pass pretrain) + 8-ep stage B
| Metric | L3-e68 (prev best) | **L3-e70** | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| typed test acc | **0.6530** | 0.6420 | -1.1 (gate 0.6530 FAIL by 0.011) |
| PhishNChips AUROC | 0.5878 | **0.6966** | **beats published Laya 0.678 AND Jev 0.689 - first program win over both** |
| Brier | **0.1382** | 0.1415 | near-par |
| G1 retention (delta rule) | hold | **+0.0032 PASS** | stage-A exit 0.6668 (E-65: 0.6625) - 520M raised the stage-A exit too |
| probe failures | **2** | 4 | regression gate FAIL |
| emotion / AG News | 0.306 / 0.272 | 0.144 / 0.240 | transfer moved between suites - trade-off now measurable |
| perm agreement | 0.2050 | 0.2000 | record-only |
The reviewer-predicted typed<->phish trade-off is empirical: token scale buys transfer (0.69 phishing, now above both published systems) while the 8-ep recipe sits at 0.642 typed with curves still rising on BOTH runs - stage-B length on the new encoder is the next length-only lever (E-72); per-source balanced replay queued (E-71).

## E-72 addendum row (2026-09-23): stage-B 12 epochs on the 520M encoder (length-only lever)
| Metric | L3-e70 | L3-e72 | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| typed test acc | 0.6420 | 0.6965 | PRIMARY PASS +5.45; first clean beat of the L2 incumbent; published-typed gap 13.5 -> 7.0 |
| PhishNChips AUROC | 0.6966 | 0.6092 | length decay -0.087; still above the 0.60 bar |
| Brier | 0.1415 | 0.1312 | line-best |
| G1 delta (adopted rule) | +0.0032 | +0.0034 PASS | retention |
| probe failures | 4 | 4 | regression gate FAIL (line-best 2) |

Length and token scale are complementary divergent levers (length -> typed, scale -> transfer). Lineage ships two artifacts: E-72 typed specialist / E-70 transfer specialist - the only model beating BOTH published benchmarks on a metric.

## E-71 addendum row (2026-09-23): per-source balanced replay on the 520M encoder, 12-ep stage B
| Metric | L3-e70 | L3-e71 | L3-e72 | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| typed test acc | 0.6420 | 0.6705 | 0.6965 | frontier point between the specialists |
| PhishNChips AUROC | 0.6966 | 0.6690 | 0.6092 | +5.98 transfer vs E-72 at -2.6 typed |
| Brier | 0.1415 | 0.1325 | 0.1312 | par |
| probe failures | 4 | 4 | 4 | held (line-best 2) |

Measured 3-point frontier on one encoder: the coupling softens under balanced replay (typed now costs only ~0.9 pt typed per 0.01 transfer lost, vs ~8.5 before).
