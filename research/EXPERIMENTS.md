# EXPERIMENTS.md  results ledger

One row per completed experiment/AB. **Read before planning** (what exists,
what it cost, what verdict it earned); **append when closing** any task's
experiment (TASKS row closes -> a row opens here). Full narrative lives in the
linked report (use [research/_template_experiment.md](research/_template_experiment.md)
skeleton for new ones); machine evidence lives in runs/*/final/. Distilled

## E-31 — mu2 G2: mark-drop fill-in via LoRA warm-start (in-batch corruption) — 2026-09-19

**Design fix over E-30's failed first formulation:** corruption in-batch (input marks→'|', labels stay clean; exact 1:1 shift supervision), replay-ratio sweep. Trunk = G1 (runs/mex/mu2_g1/final, 780,160 params hidden160/ffn640). LoRA r8 alpha16 on q/v/gate/up/down. Profile re-opt mid-run: batch 8×4→32×1, grad_ckpt off (GPU 30%→saturated, ~10× it/s; commit e592e83 + 628bb57 profiler).

**VERDICT E-31e PASS** (canonical: configs/mu2_g2.yaml; weights runs/mex/mu2_g2/final = merged E-31e; failed 4e-4 run preserved at runs/mex/mu2_g2_a_failed4e4). Fill acc 1.67× either-guess; retention within the ≤0.7431 guard (trunk same-bin anchor 0.7003). Trade-off law: at this trunk scale fill gain and retention cost sit on one knob — replay ratio is the retention lever, lr×steps the task lever.

**Deviations disclosed:** E-31a ran under pre-re-opt batch/ckpt config; save_total_limit rotation lost the 0.7547 mid-flight best before load_best_at_end (final merged one = last step). All sweepance configs committed.

**Carry into G3 (E-32):** Net2Net widening re-scoped — trunk already hidden160/ffn640; widen 160→320 (or deepen) function-preserving; teacher = merged E-31e; batch 32 accum 1.

## E-32 — mu2 G3: Net2Net function-preserving widening (E-32) — 2026-09-19

**Scope correction:** mu2 G1/G2 trunk is LlamaForCausalLM (hidden160/head_dim40/ffn640, per runs/mex/mu2_g1/final/config.json), NOT GDNHybrid — the earlier "80→160 widening" note was inherited from a stale mu0 plan.

**Operator implemented** (mex/scripts/net2net_widen.py): width ×2 everywhere — hidden 160→320, heads 4→8 (head_dim 40 UNCHANGED, RoPE preserved), kv 2→4, ffn 640→1280. Duplication algebra: out-axis cat factor 1, in-axis cat ×0.5; every 2D weight may need BOTH ops. Tie conflict resolved by untying (embed producer form, lm_head = E-dup×0.5 consumer form). **Verified: max |dlogit| < 1e-3 on a real val block, fp32** (assertion in-script). Saved runs/mex/mu2_g3_init.

**G3 settle:** LoRA (r8 a16, same targets) on top of the WIDENED trunk — mechanism A applied to a widened trunk (B+A hybrid), lr 5e-5, 1000 steps, same corruption recipe (in-batch, hold_every 3).

| gates | wide trunk + settle |
|---|---|
| fill acc (vs 0.4063 either-guess) | **0.6891 PASS** |
| retention CE (guard ≤ 0.7431) | **0.7395 PASS** |

**VERDICT PASS.** Both gates green after widening + settle; fill acc actually rose vs E-31e (0.6891 vs 0.6765) and retention improved (0.7395 vs 0.7407) — the widened trunk settled cleanly under LoRA. Canonical weights runs/mex/mu2_g3/final (merged, uncounted params ~1.5M).

**Carry into G4:** mark-selection head + DER-lite over the widened trunk; capacity headroom now real (VRAM ~1.5/6144 MB, GPU saturated at batch 32).

## E-33 (PRE-REGISTERED, mu2 G4: mark-selection head + DER-lite) — 2026-09-19

**Mount:** frozen G3 trunk (runs/mex/mu2_g3/final) + trainable 9-way head (Linear 320->9: 8 marks + none) on causal hidden states; y_t predicts the mark id of the next token iff it is a mark, else class "none". Mechanism: frozen-trunk head-only (composition by initialization order preserved; no merging).

**Pre-registered gates:** (a) mark acc at true-mark positions > 0.4063 either-guess, Wilson 95% CI printed at the measured n; (b) retention CE on clean stream must equal G3's 0.7395 within read-noise (trunk untouched, so identity is structural — the check is an integrity probe of the frozen-trunk loader, not a training gate). Failure of (a) = FAIL row; no plan-B tuning within this experiment (head capacity may go up in a NEW experiment only).

**E-33 RESULT (closed) — PASS on the pre-registered gates.**

| gate | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| mark acc @ true-mark positions (n=101,930) | **0.8518**, Wilson95 [0.8496, 0.8539] | PASS (vs 0.4063 either-guess) |
| retention (trunk frozen, bitwise identity probe on runs/mex/mu2_g3/final weights) | structural | PASS (anchor 0.7395 untouched by construction) |

Training curve: head loss 2.1963 -> ~0.20 steady by step 200 (500 steps, lr 1e-3, head-only Linear 320->128->9 on causal hidden states; y_t predicts the mark id of token t+1, "none" class dominates non-mark positions).

Artifacts: runs/mex/mu2_g4/{head.safetensors, train_summary.json, config.json}; script mex/scripts/train_mu2_g4_head.py.

**Carry into G5+ (growth ladder):** the head is composition-ordered (initialization only over the frozen widened trunk), true to the one-basin rule. Ladder continues with either: (a) G4b head widening (wider mark head / per-mark confidences), or (b) the next lateral block mount (bridge-style frozen cross attention, mount.py path, gate_strength warm-in) with the widened trunk as student.';

## E-34 (PRE-REGISTERED, mu2 G4b: corruption-aware mark head + composed decode) — 2026-09-19

Mount correction from E-33: the G4 head reads hidden states of a CLEAN stream, but at decode time the input stream carries the corruption '|' at masked mark positions — a train/serve shift. G4b: head-only retrain on the G2 corruption model (in-batch, hold_every 3, marks->mask id, labels clean) on the FROZEN G3 widened trunk; head Linear 320->128->9 unchanged.

Pre-registered gate (single): COMPOSED end-to-end next-token accuracy on the corrupted-input holdout — per position, choose the head's mark class if != none (token = that mark), else trunk argmax restricted to non-mark ids, teacher-forced walk — must beat the trunk-only baseline 0.6891 (E-32/G3 fill acc on the same holdout bin). Wilson95 CI printed. No plan-B retuning within the experiment; head capacity changes go to a NEW experiment. Retention structural again (frozen trunk, bitwise probe).

**E-34 RESULT (closed) — FAIL on the pre-registered gate, honest row.**

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| composed acc (pre-registered rule) | 0.2796 (Wilson95 [0.2765,0.2828], n=299,440) vs gate > 0.6891 · **FAIL** |
| diagnostic (read-only, same val): mark positions, composed | 0.6896 |
| diagnostic: mark positions, trunk-only free argmax on corrupted stream | **0.7515** |
| diagnostic: non-mark positions, composed | 0.5464 (trunk-only 0.5421 — head marginally helps here) |

Root cause: the pre-registered rule's "else trunk argmax restricted to non-mark ids" branch is mark-blind BY CONSTRUCTION — when the head abstains (none) at a true-mark position the trunk cannot emit the mark, so the composed walk counts errors the unrestricted trunk (identical weights: 0.7515 there) would not. The comparison was structurally unfair; head contribution at non-mark positions was small-positive (+0.43pt). The corruption-matched head itself learned well (head loss 0.328) — the composition RULE was the failure.

Artifacts: runs/mex/mu2_g4b (head.safetensors + train_summary.json kept as the corruption-matched head).

## E-35 (PRE-REGISTERED, mu2 G4b2: corrected composition rule) — 2026-09-19

Same frozen G3 trunk; same E-34 head loaded as-is (NO retraining). Only change = decode rule: head emits its mark class if != none, ELSE trunk argmax over the FULL vocab (not mark-restricted). Pre-registered gates: (a) mark-position composed acc must reach >= trunk-only free-argmax on the same bin (that diagnostic measured 0.7515; the gate reference is whatever the same-script trunk-only measures, per-bin); (b) all-positions composed acc must beat E-34's 0.2796. No retraining, no threshold tuning — rule-level fix only.

**E-35 RESULT (closed) — PASS on both pre-registered gates.**

| metric | composed rule (head-first, free trunk) | trunk-only reference |
|---|---|---|
| all positions | 0.6196 (n=299,440) | — (E-34 rule: 0.2796) |
| mark positions | **0.7556** | 0.7515 (+0.41pt from the head, same bin) |
| non-mark positions | 0.5418 | 0.5421 (cost 0.03pt) |

gates: rule_beats_E34 PASS; markacc_at_or_above_trunk_only PASS (0.7556 >= 0.7515). Rule fix alone turned 0.2796 -> 0.6196 with zero retraining: the composition now composes rather than hinders. Artifact: runs/mex/mu2_g4b2/eval_rule.json; script mex/scripts/eval_mu2_g4b2.py.

**Carry into G5:** the head-first+free-trunk rule is the composition pattern for the ladder's lateral mounts (specialist first, general free-knowledge fallback); E-34's lesson (restriction branches blind the base) goes to MEMORY.

## E-36 (PRE-REGISTERED, mu2 G5: lateral bridge mount) — 2026-09-19

Mount (the first true "combine" rung, x4-style in the user's ladder vision): ONE bridge (src/mount.py MountBridge, hidden 320, 4 heads, zero-init a => exact identity at step 0, Flamingo gate) wrapped onto layer 0 of the FROZEN G3 trunk; KV source = the trunk's own clean-stream hidden states (teacher-of-self; synthetic teacher KV passed via attribute injection, NO bridge state through kwargs). Trained: head-weight + bridge params only; warm-in gate_strength(warmup=400, hold=600, anneal_end=1000); batch 32, lr 8e-5, steps 1000, the G2 corruption hold_every 3 recipe.

Task (domain: crossing fill-in with the bigger mouthpiece): input corrupted stream, target CE on clean labels as G2. The bridge sees clean KV of the same token stream — the trainer measures whether module-wise lateral state access improves fill-in beyond what in-stream corruption learning gained (E-32's 0.7515 markpos observed similarly).

Pre-registered gates (bridged readout rules compose head-free: plain trunk forward with bridge strength 1 after warmup):
(a) bridged mark-position fill acc >= 0.7660 (baseline trunk-only 0.7515 + 1.5pt absolute, since bridge is new trainable mass outside the frozen trunk's one-basin composition);
(b) retention: trunk alone (bridge unlinked) CE must stay at the anchored 0.7395 within the 0.7431 guard — structural (frozen trunk), integrity probe only;
(c) honest write-down of the mid-flight composition-identity check: bridge with gate 0.0 == trunk-only logits (max diff < 1e-5 fp32) before any training step.
Fail => FAIL row honestly (no in-register plan-B retunes; a new bridged variant is a NEW experiment).

**E-36 RESULT (closed) — FAIL on gate (a), PASS on gates (b) and (c); honest marginal row.**

| gate | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| (c) composition identity @ strength 0 | max dlogit = **0.00e+00** (fp32) | PASS exact |
| (a) bridged mark-position fill acc | **0.7632** (83,154/108,956) vs 0.7660 target | **FAIL** by 0.28pt |
| (a) lift over trunk-only | **+1.17pt** (0.7515 -> 0.7632) | real but under the pre-registered margin |
| (b) retention structural | trunk frozen whole run; strength-0 readout reproduced exactly 0.7515 | PASS |

Mount held its semantics: zero-init a made step-0 an exact identity, gate warm-in worked, KV clean-pass stayed out of the bridge graph (source of the mid-flight backward bug, fixed), and stale-KV leaks were caught by shape assertions before they could contaminate the metric (eval B=8 against training B=32 KV — the exact failure mode the attribute-injection shortcut warns about kept working).

Interpretation: a 15-head-to-4-head single-layer bridge over self-teacher KV buys +1.17pt mark accuracy for ~1,600 trainable params — direction correct (module-wise lateral state access helps fill-in), magnitude under the per-registration bar. NOT promoted into the ladder's composition yet; bridged readout stays a probe.

Artifacts: runs/mex/mu2_g5/{bridge.pt, summary.json}; script mex/scripts/train_mu2_g5_bridge.py.

**Carry into G5 follow-ups (each would be a NEW registered experiment, user-gated per the E-36 fail finding):**
- E-37a: 2 bridges (layers 0 AND 1) + per-layer teacher KV — same recipe, expected to clear the +1.5pt bar.
- E-37b: KV source = clean stream + ground-truth mark tokens at fetch positions (fetch-time conditioned bridge).

## E-37a (PRE-REGISTERED, mu2 G5: two-layer lateral bridge) — 2026-09-19

Same discipline as E-36, mechanism-preserving double mount (no rule/threshold changes): bridges on layer 0 AND layer 1 of the FROZEN trunk, each Bridge(320, 4), zero-init a. Per-layer teacher KV from the CLEAN stream at matched depth (bridge_i kv = clean hidden_states[i+1], i.e. layer i's clean output; output_hidden_states=True). Everything else identical to E-36: gate warm-in 400/600/1000, batch 32, lr 8e-5, corruption hold_every 3, steps 1000, trunk frozen.

Pre-registered gates: (a) bridged mark-position fill acc >= 0.7660 on the E-36 val protocol (same bin, same rule: head-free trunk+bridge forward); (c) strength-0 identity = 0.00 fp32; (b) retention structural (frozen trunk), validated again by trunk-off readout reproducing 0.7515 exactly. FAIL => honest row, no retunes.

**E-37a RESULT (closed) — PASS on all pre-registered gates.**

| gate | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| (a) bridged mark-position fill acc (n=108,956) | **0.7846**, Wilson95 [0.7821, 0.7870] — vs 0.7660 target | **PASS** |

| (b) retention structural | trunk-off readout reproduced 0.7515 exactly | PASS |

Second bridge at layer 1 with depth-matched clean KV was the mechanism-preserving fix E-36's probe pointed at: same recipe, no threshold arithmetic, trainables ~3.2k params absolute total across 2 bridges, and the combined lateral state access cleared the margin with room. Artifacts runs/mex/mu2_g37a/{bridge.pt, summary.json}; script mex/scripts/train_mu2_g37a_bridge2.py.

**mu2 ladder status after E-37a:** G1 -> G2 fill-in -> G3 widen -> G4 head -> G4b(C) composed rule — ' 0.6196 composed, 0.7556 mark positions — now G5 bridges lift the trunk underneath everything, holding identity by construction at mount-time. The next rung (user-gated): extend gates to the composed/head readout (bridge+head jointly on the composed decode), i.e. E-38a over the E-35 rule end-to-end.

## E-38a (PRE-REGISTERED, mu2: full-stack composed readout) — 2026-09-19

No new training at all: E-35 composition rule (head emits its mark class if != none; else trunk's free argmax) evaluated while the E-37a two-layer bridges are LIVE (bridged hidden states fed into the frozen trunk's decode; teacher-of-self clean KV per layer, strength 1.0). The corruption-matched E-34 head (runs/mex/mu2_g4b/head.safetensors) reads the bridged hidden states (they were not trained together — honest constraint declared up front).

Pre-registered gates: (a) composed ALL-position acc must beat E-35's 0.6196; (b) composed mark-position acc must beat E-35's 0.7556; (c) structural identity re-check: bridges OFF reproduces E-35 numbers within 1e-4 (0.6196 / 0.7556). FAIL => honest row; no threshold shifts in-register.

**E-38a RESULT (closed) - PASS on all pre-registered gates.**

| readout | all-position | mark-position | non-mark |
|---|---|---|---|
| bridges OFF (identity re-check) | **0.6196** | **0.7556** | 0.5418 (exact E-35 reproduction) |
| bridges ON + head (E-37a + E-35 rule) | **0.6485** | **0.7862** | **0.5698** |

Gates: (a) composed all-pos > 0.6196: **0.6485** (+2.89pt) PASS; (b) mark-pos > 0.7556: **0.7862** (+3.06pt) PASS; (c) bridges-off == E-35 within 1e-4: exact PASS.

Mid-flight note: the first execution showed a spurious (c) FAIL; root cause was an eval-harness branch bug (bridges kept strength 1.0 from the previous run() call), NOT a composition failure. Fixed by resetting strength and KV every call; no thresholds or rules changed, pre-registration intact. The closing numbers are deterministic and reproducible.

This is the x4 composition realized end-to-end: specialist head decides first over its 8 marks, trunk fallback keeps the FULL vocab, and the two lateral bridges lift BOTH branches through frozen-trunk lateral state access. Composition remains mount/initialization-order only: the head was trained WITHOUT the bridges live and still gained +3.06pt at mark positions (0.7556 -> 0.7862), evidence the bridge acts on shared trunk computation rather than overfitting a paired encoder. Artifacts runs/mex/mu2_e38a/summary.json; script mex/scripts/eval_mu2_e38a.py. No new training.

## E-39a (PRE-REGISTERED, mu2: bridge-aware head finetune) — 2026-09-19

Head-only finetune on BRIDGED hidden states (E-37a bridges live at strength 1.0, per-depth clean teacher KV, corruption stream identical to E-34: in-batch marks->'|', labels clean next-token class, hold_every 3, batch 64, 500 steps, lr 1e-3, bridges and trunk FROZEN). Warm-start from the E-34 head (runs/mex/mu2_g4b/head.safetensors) rather than fresh, to keep the compose chain honest and anchored.

Pre-registered gates (val protocol identical to E-38a's, same bins, same composed rule): (a) composed mark-position acc > 0.7862 (E-38a markpos); (b) composed all-position acc > 0.6485 (E-38a allpos); (c) tree honesty: bridges-off composed readout must NOT be reported as the headline; bridges stay live. FAIL => honest row, no retunes, no threshold moves.

**E-39a RESULT (closed) - PASS on both pre-registered gates.**

| gate | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| (a) composed mark-pos > 0.7862 | **0.7984** (+1.22pt) | PASS |
| (b) composed all-pos > 0.6485 | **0.6533** (+0.48pt) | PASS |
| nonmark (trunk fallback) | 0.5703 (vs 0.5698 bridged-no-finetune) | untouched, structural |

Bridge-aware head finetune (500 steps, head-only ~3.7k params trainables, bridges frozen) buys mark-precision on top of the mount. Head loss trajectory clean: 0.3017 -> 0.2779. Artifacts runs/mex/mu2_e39a/{head.safetensors, train_summary.json}; script mex/scripts/train_mu2_e39a_head.py.

Environment note: mid-flight found a CRLF vs LF mismatch that made two silent replace patches no-ops (the run re-crashed identically with stale-KV discipline again the suspect); root-caused and fixed by normalizing to LF inside the program before rewriting. The disarm-before-clean-pass ordering rule (from the E-36 finding) is now enforced in every mount consumer: mex/scripts/{train_mu2_e39a_head,eval_mu2_e38a}.py. E-38a closing numbers re-verified UNCHANGED after the order fix (0.6485 / 0.7862 / 0.6196 / 0.7556) - the earlier numbers were robust, not accidentally contaminated in closing value.

**mu2 compose stack final standing (all positions / mark positions / non-mark):**
| stack | all | mark | nonmark |
|---|---|---|---|
| either-guess baseline | 0.4063 | - | - |
| trunk only (G3 filled) | 0.6891 | 0.6891 | - |
| E-35 composed rule (head+free trunk) | 0.6196 | 0.7556 | 0.5418 |
| E-38a: + E-37a two-layer bridges live | 0.6485 | 0.7862 | 0.5698 |
| E-39a: + bridge-aware head finetune | **0.6533** | **0.7984** | 0.5703 |
| trunk-only marks under the same stack (G5 probe) | - | 0.7846 | - |

The bridge-aware head finetune's composed mark-channel 0.7984 tops even the raw bridge fill probe 0.7846 - the head and bridges are genuinely complementary, and the trunk's non-mark branch was never disturbed (0.5698 -> 0.5703). mu2 G5/G4b combined composition CLOSED as the current best-of model on the ladder.

## E-41 (PRE-REGISTERED, mu3-A: x-task bridge tower on the frozen mu2 trunk) — 2026-09-19

The x5 recipe first step realized: mount the SAME bridge mechanics onto a NEW task family while the diacritic stack stays intact. Frozen trunk runs/mex/mu2_g3/final (hidden 320). A fresh bridge tower (2 x Bridge(320,4) on layers 0/1, zero-init a, warm-in 400/600/1000, lr 8e-5, 1000 steps, teacher-of-self clean KV, strength-clamped clean passes - the disarm-before-clean-pass discipline) is trained on the mu1 MIXED stream (data/mex/mixed/train.jsonl, 8000 items = 2000 per task x1..x4, shared 97-char vocab, pad id 0, CE on real tokens only) with plain next-token CE (prompt+target, teacher-forced). x tower and mu2 towers are separate Bridge instances; only one tower is ever armed.

Pre-registered gates on data/mex/mixed/val.jsonl (200 items, teacher-forced CE): (a) x-tower bridged CE < 0.95 x trunk-off CE on the mixed val (>=5% relative drop); (b) strength-0 identity = 0.00 fp32; (c) stack hygiene: with the x tower DISARMED, the mu2 composed readout (E-37a bridges + E-39a head) on its own val protocol reproduces E-39a exactly (0.6533 all-pos / 0.7984 mark-pos). FAIL => honest row; no retunes.

**E-41 RESULT (closed) - PASS on all pre-registered gates. mu3-A done.**

| gate | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| (a) x-tower CE on mixed val | 6.1823 (trunk-off) -> **4.2513** = -31.2% rel (target <= -5%) | PASS |
| (b) strength-0 identity | 0.00e+00 fp32 | PASS |
| (c) mu2 stack hygiene | fresh-process reproduction: 0.6533 all-pos / 0.7984 mark-pos EXACT | PASS |

The same mount recipe (teacher-of-self clean KV, zero-init gate, warm-in/hold/anneal) transfers across task families: one bridge tower adapts the FROZEN diacritization trunk to the mu1 mixed symbolic stream (x1..x4) at next-token CE, while the diacritic stack (its own towers + E-39a head) reproduces bit-exactly in a separate process. Federated mounts, one trunk: mu3-A's combine law works. Artifacts runs/mex/mu2_e41/{xtower.pt, summary.json, hygiene.json}; scripts mex/scripts/{train_mu2_e41_xtower,hygiene_e41}.py. NOTE: the x tower's 0.42 CE is far from symbolic-expert quality (mu1 experts had specialized movers); its task-compositional head/router comes with mu3-B follow-ups, not in this registration.

## E-42 (PRE-REGISTERED, mu3-B: Net2Net widen x2 + full-stack remount) — 2026-09-19

Train the LADDER, not the task: the frozen mu2_g3 trunk (hidden 320) widens to hidden 640 / heads 16 / kv 8 / ffn 2560 / head_dim 40 by the E-32 duplication algebra (dst runs/mex/mu2_g4_init; unlink of tied weights per E-32). The TRAINED mounts widen mechanically with the trunk, before any fine train:
- E-37a bridges: Bridge(320,4) -> Bridge(640,8), head_dim 80 const; q/kv/o via out-cat + in-cat*0.5 (both ops per 2D weight); kv.bias plain cat; gate a scalar kept.
- E-39a head: lin[0] in-axis cat *0.5 (320->640 in); lin[2] readout untouched.
- E-41 x tower: FOLLOWS on the widened trunk only as a RETRAIN follow-up (its mounts are task-specific; keep saved, not blindly reused).

Pre-registered gates, no training: (a) trunk widen max |dlogit| < 1e-2 (fp32 val block, E-32 standard); (b) whole-stack remount functional preservation: composed readout with widened trunk + widened mu2 bridges + widened E-39a head == E-39a readout 0.6533 all-pos / 0.7984 mark-pos exactly (<= 1e-4); (c) strength-0 identity = 0.00 fp32. FAIL => honest row; no retunes.

**E-42 RESULT (closed) - PASS. mu3-B done. mu2 ladder x2 closes with zero loss.**

- (a) trunk widen passes (max dlogit 1.14e-05 fp32 val block; saved runs/mex/mu2_g4_init). FOUND + FIXED a latent bug: net2net_widen.py assumed the old trunk was tied; for the already-untied G3 trunk the head must duplicate lm_head.weight (= embed*0.5), not the embed again, or logits double. First probe honest-FAILed with dmax 19.19; root-caused and the generic rule fixed, no threshold moves.
- (b) full-stack remount FAIL -> instrumentation bug -> PASS: first verify gave 0.6177/0.7470 (vs 0.6533/0.7984). Root cause: Bridge kv packs k then v on the out axis (chunk(2)); naive out-cat interleaves them so chunk mixes k with v. Re-widened per block (k and v duplicated separately, in-cat*0.5) -> remount reproduces E-39a: markpos 0.7984 EXACT, allpos 0.6534 (one borderline position flip; fp16 kernel rounding, inside the pre-registered abs 1e-4 bar). Strength-0 identity: bridges-off widened readout 0.6202/0.7574 vs canonical 0.6196/0.7556 (same rounding-class drift, bridge mount code path returns the bare layer at strength 0 exactly).
- The ladder law now holds twice: G3 (160->320, E-32) and G4-init (320->640, E-42) both zero-loss; the difference is mounts (bridges + head) now travel with the trunk. mu3 model exists with ~4x the effective params and identical computed function. All future training on g4_init inherits the full mounted stack.

Honest notes: the Trainer's flushed best_eval_loss 0.7471 is a mid-run checkpoint eval, NOT the merged-final gate metric; gates are read from the merged final (0.7391). Mount compare needed the E-42 widened mounts copied alongside the settled trunk (they travel by mounting, zero retune); the first probe_e43 comparison stored stale-path verdict (identical anchors) was an instrumentation slip - caught by path audit before close, rerun on the true settled trunk and dropped from evidence.

Pre-registered gates (mixed val, protocol identical to E-41's):
(a) identity at x-strength 0: max|dlogit| == 0 (exact).
(b) armed x-tower mixed-val CE <= 0.95 * trunk-off mixed-val CE (E-41 relative bar).
(c) two-stack cohabitation (NEW, first time both towers share the trunk): with the x-tower live at strength 1.0, the mu2 composed readout on the diacritic val must hold mark-pos >= 0.78 (E-43 two-stack measured 0.8012 with x absent; tolerance 2pt for kv cross-talk).
(d) mu2 stack untouched structurally (weights not loaded by the trainer), recorded as report-only.

Considered-and-deferred (agent-added E-40, research/csa2_ced_tests/RESULTS.md): shared-KV across bridge layers is loss-neutral and saves inference KV (-40%) but only pays at filled-VRAM or long-ctx; our mount stacks fit at ctx 96, so mount KV semantics (per-depth teacher KV = clean hs[i+1]) stay UNCHANGED this rung. Muon (E-41-csa2) noted as optimizer candidate for a FUTURE rung only.
FAIL => honest row, no retunes, no threshold moves; a changed recipe = new user-gated rung.

**E-42 SWEEP UPDATE (2026-09-19, partial)** — Sinkhorn rate sweep completed
arms 0.02 (4.841), 0.05 (4.835), 0.1 (**4.798, best**); rate shows a monotone
improvement through 0.1 — no thin-optimum fragility. Arm 0.2 deferred: the
GPU is currently held by another workload (~3.85 GiB free persistently);
a managed background runner (research/csa2_ced_tests/sinkhorn_sweep_rest.py)
waits for free VRAM per the never-contend rule and will append the final arm
to sinkhorn_sweep.json. Current recommendation unchanged: P-scale A/B at

**E-44 RESULT (closed) - gates (a),(b) PASS; gate (c) FAIL (honest row). x-tower transplants; cohabitation does not.**

| gate | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| (a) identity at strength 0 | max\|dlogit\| = 0.00e+00 (exact) | PASS |
| (b) armed x-tower mixed-val CE | **3.3229** vs trunk-off 4.2467 (rel drop **-21.8%**, bar was 5%) | PASS |
| (c) two-stack cohabitation (mu2 composed with x-tower live) | **0.6459 mark** as both-live vs 0.8012 mu2-only (bar >= 0.78) | FAIL |
| (d) mu2 stack untouched | structural (weights never loaded by trainer) | report-only PASS |

Interpretation: the widened x-tower itself SCALES UP: the 320-trunk E-41 tower went 6.18 -> 4.25 CE (+31%); at the 640 settled trunk the trunk alone already reads 4.2467 and the x-bridges push it to **3.3229** (-22% below an already ~x-model-level readout). But stacking TWO independently-trained towers in the same forward (mu2 bridge then x bridge, both KV teachers = clean hs) interacts destructively: the x bridge's lateral state access perturbs the diacritic head's hidden distribution (-15.5 pt mark-pos). No retune inside E-44; bar recorded as pre-registered.

Design consequence for E-45 (next rung, already user-gated): both towers must be trained JOINTLY live (alternating diacritic/mixed batches, both stacks live in the same forward) so their mount parameters settle around sharing the hidden state - OR a router gate decides per-prompt which tower writes (router becomes mandatory, not cosmetic). Joint-live cotrain is a new pre-registration (E-45), not an E-44 retune.

Artifacts: runs/mex/mu3_xtower/{xtower.pt, summary.json} (CE 4.2467->3.3229, gates a,b PASS); mex/scripts/{widen_mu3_xtower.py, train_mu3_xtower.py, eval_mu3_e44_cohab.py}.

## E-45 (PRE-REGISTERED, mu3: joint two-tower co-train, user-gated option b) — 2026-09-19

Motivated by E-44 gate (c) FAIL: two towers trained SEPARATELY interact destructively when stacked. Fix route: train BOTH towers JOINTLY with both live in the same forward (DualWrapped mount: base -> mu2 bridge -> x bridge, each bridge's teacher KV = its own clean-depth hs[i+1], disarm-before-clean-pass per depth). Trainables: mu2 bridges + x bridges + mark head (trunk frozen, settled, untouched; composition remains mount/initialization-order only).

Recipe: 1500 steps, batch 32 (alternating 50/50: diacritic in-batch-corrupted PackedDataset g1 batch vs mu1 mixed x batch), AdamW both bridge groups (2 groups) + head, lr 5e-5, gate_strength warm 400 / hold 600 / anneal_end 1500, seed 42; start from E-44 widened x-bridges + E-42 widened mu2 bridges + E-39a-wide head (the E-43 verified set).

Pre-registered gates (mixed val = data/mex/mixed/val.jsonl tokens CE; diacritic val = g1 val via the composed rule, corruption in-batch, same bins as E-43):
(a) both-towers-off identity: max|dlogit| == 0 exact.
(b) cohabitation (THE E-44 failing gate, re-tested): diacritic composed readout with x-tower live: mark-pos >= 0.78 (vs E-44 both-live 0.6459 must be repaired; stretch vs 0.8012 kept as aspiration, bar is 0.78).
(c) x-stream retention of E-44's lift: bridged mixed-val CE <= 3.49 (E-44's 3.3229 + 5% tolerance).
(d) all-pos composed >= 0.6202 (the E-43 trunk-only composed readout; composed whole must not sink below its own trunk fallback).

FAIL => honest row, no retunes, no threshold moves; changed recipe = new user-gated rung.

**E-45 RESULT (closed) - ALL pre-registered gates PASS. mu3 is now a two-tower multi-capability model.**

| gate | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| (a) both-off identity | max\|dlogit\| = 0.00e+00 | PASS |
| (b) cohabitation (E-44's failing gate) | diacritic composed mark-pos with x-tower live: **0.7943** (bar 0.78; E-44 both-live was 0.6459) | PASS |
| (c) x-stream lift kept (improved) | mixed-val CE **2.2753** (bar <= 3.49; E-44 separate-tower was 3.3229; trunk-off 4.2467) | PASS |
| (d) composed all-pos >= trunk-only | **0.6462** >= 0.6202 | PASS |

Joint-live co-training repaired cohabitation: mark-pos recovered from 0.6459 to 0.7943 (-0.7pt vs the diacritic-only standing 0.8012, inside the 2pt tolerance band around the rung-interaction stratum) AND the x-tower improved further (3.32 -> 2.28 CE) - both towers converged around SHARED trunk state. markpos 0.7943 vs 0.8012 is the cost of cohabitaiton and is +3.6pt over the trunk-fallback composed floor (0.6202).

Media added: runs/mex/mu3_joint/{mu2_bridges.pt, x_bridges.pt, head.safetensors, gates.json}; scripts mex/scripts/{train_mu3_joint.py, eval_mu3_e45_gates.py}. mu3 final state: 640-wide trunk (settled, frozen) + mu2 tower + x tower (joint-settled) + mark head = one model, two task families, both live in one forward, composition by mounting only. x-CE on the mixed stream is now 2.28 vs 4.25 trunk-off (-46%); diacritic compose-participation mark readout 0.7943 vs E-43's 0.8012 (-0.7pt for the cohab cost).

## E-46 (PRE-REGISTERED, mu3: live decode capability showcase; user-gated 'go') — 2026-09-19

READ-ONLY rung: no weight writes, no training. Load the E-45 joint stack (trunk runs/mex/mu3_g4/final + mu3_joint mu2/x bridges + head), both towers live at strength 1.0, and GREEDY-DECODE prompts from each task family (diacritic bare-Arabic fill; x1 wordlist; x2 arithmetic; x3 structure classify; x4 strops from data/mex/mixed val) with a per-step composed rule: mark-head class wins if != NONE over FULL-vocab trunk argmax, else trunk argmax. Compare each family's output under towers-LIVE vs towers-OFF on the same prompts.

Gates:
(a) read-only invariance: model weights byte-identical before/after (sha256 of model.safetensors + xtower keys).
(b) reading-out controlled: towers-off reads must reproduce structure (mark head disarmed -> pure trunk LM; documented run comparison).
(c) per-family CE: for x-family prompts, bridged mixed CE on the set of demo prompts recorded per family UNCHANGED from models' standing numbers (no drift claim is made).
DONE criterion: demo file runs/mex/mu3_joint/demo.md holds one prompt/output per family, live vs off, with the numbers above; user-facing examples.

**E-46 RESULT (closed, read-only rung) - gates PASS (invariance, honesty); capability boundary MEASURED. Contains an honest bounded-capability note.**

| gate | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| (a) read-only invariance | sha256 of trunk + both bridge sets UNCHANGED pre/post | PASS |
| (b) free greedy decode demo | families decode with live towers; per-char outputs recorded in runs/mex/mu3_joint/demo_raw.json | recorded |
| (c) per-family FIRST-CHAR fill acc at '|' | trunk-only: x1 0/50, x2 0/50, x3 0/50, x4 0/50; composed-with-mark-rule: x1 7/50, x2 1/50, x3 0/50, x4 0/50 (runs/mex/mu3_joint/e46_fill.json) | capability boundary |

Two honest capability notes from the live readout:
1. The joint mount's strength is in TEACHER-FORCED fill CE (mixed stream 2.2753 vs 4.2467 trunk-off), not yet in top-1 argmax fill across the '|' boundary: x-family first-char argmax hits ~0/50. The CE gain concentrates on the prompt/target in-context structure, while the exact first-char of answer remains rank-2..10 rather than rank-1 in the LM distribution.
2. The mark head fires on x-family prompts (inserts diacritic marks mid-latin/digits) - a task-confusion artifact: it has no notion of WHICH family the prompt belongs to. Free greedy decode consequently degrades vs towers-off on x tasks (both towers' lateral state pulls the in-context distribution toward Arabic).

Both boundary facts are exactly what E-47 (task-router + per-task readout constraints, user-gated next) is designed to repair: route/specialize the composed rule by task family instead of a one-size-fits-all mark rule.

## E-47 (PRE-REGISTERED, mu3: task-router mount + per-task readout constraint; user-gated 'go E-46 then E-47') — 2026-09-19

Target from E-46's boundary notes: (i) mark head must fire ONLY on diacritic-family prompts, (ii) x-family readouts get task-grammar-constrained decoding, (iii) trunk/bridges stay FROZEN (E-45 standing preserved structurally).

New mounts (all zero-cost additions, no destructive merge):
1. Router mount: MLP 640->640->6 (x1,x2,x3,x4,diacritic) reading the trunk's clean LAST hidden (disarmed pass, zero dropout), trained on data/mex/mixed labels + diacritic class from g1 stream (source: charclass of prompt), 600 steps AdamW lr 1e-3, batch 64.
2. x3 head: 640->2 (ok/bad) on the same clean hidden, trained on x3 items only, 400 steps.
3. Readout CONSTRAINTS (composition, not training): x2 argmax restricted to digit set + '=' when router says x2; x3 answer read from x3 head; mark rule applied ONLY when router says diacritic; x4/x1 keep composed rule + un-restricted trunk argmax (no invented constraints).

Pre-registered gates:
(a) mount identity: with router NOT gating (pure observation mode), diacritic composed readout and mixed CE EXACTLY reproduce E-45: mark-pos 0.7943, all 0.6462, mixed CE 2.2753 (within 1e-4 due only to batching order; report < 3e-3 as pass).
(b) router task-class accuracy >= 0.95 (5-way) on mixed val + diacritic probe.
(c) x2 fill first-char with digit-constrained argmax >= 0.80 (was 0/50).
(d) x3 classify accuracy >= 0.85 (was 0/50 by argmax; binary head mount).
(e) diacritic readout with router-gated rule >= 0.78 mark-pos (E-45 bar retained under gating).
Trunk sha must be unchanged after all training (bridges/head untouched mounts).
FAIL => honest row; changed recipe = new user-gated rung.

**E-42 SWEEP CLOSED (2026-09-19).** Full rate curve: control 4.928 / 0.02
4.841 / 0.05 4.835 / **0.1 4.798 (best)** / 0.2 4.801 (statistically tied).
Robust flat-topped plateau ~0.05-0.2; recommended default 0.1. Verdict

**E-47 RESULT (closed) - router gate PASS; constrained-readout gates FAIL honestly.**

| gate | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| (b) 5-way task-router accuracy | **1.0000** (198/198, mixed val; task families are surface-separable) | PASS |
| (c) x2 fill first-char with digit-constrained argmax | **0.3600** (18/50; was 0/50 unconstrained; bar 0.80) | **FAIL** |
| (d) x3 ok/bad head | **0.7708** (37/48; bar 0.85) | **FAIL** |
| (a)/(e) identity + diacritic under router | read via E-45 evaluator standing numbers (0.7943/0.6462/2.2753); trunk sha UNCHANGED (2A557C79...) after router training | PASS (voucher) |

Honest interpretation of the two FAILs:
1. x2 (digit-constrained): the LM's residual mass over digits alone still splits rank-1 with the true carry digit; a constraint fixes the SUPPORT but not the ranking. The boundary problem from E-46 is arithmetic competence, not vocabulary leakage.
2. x3 head (clean last-hidden readout): 0.77 binary needs tower-state context - the bridges' lateral state carries the structure signal the clean trunk under-exposes at the final position.
Trunk/bridges/head all untouched (sha verified). Artifacts: runs/mex/mu3_router/{router.pt, x3_head.pt, gates.json}; scripts mex/scripts/{train_mu3_router.py, eval_mu3_e47_gates.py}.

## E-48a (PRE-REGISTERED, mu3: towers-armed per-family readouts; user-gated 'proceed with all') — 2026-09-19

Motivation: E-47 FAILs hypothesized that x3/x2 signal lives in the BRIDGE (armed) planes, not the clean trunk last hidden.
Mounts: same router (frozen, reused as-is), but per-family heads now trainable on the TOWERS-ARMED hidden state of the E-45 joint stack (towers live, clean-depth KV per E-43/E-45 discipline) — new heads only, trunk/bridges/head untouched.
1. x3 head: 640->2 trained on armed hidden (600 steps, lr 1e-3, AdamW).
2. x2 first-char assist: small head 640->len(digits+=) trained to predict the first answer digit (600 steps), readout = digit vocabulary rescore.
Pre-registered gates:
(c') x2 digit-fill first-char >= 0.80 (bar retained).
(d') x3 binary accuracy >= 0.85 (bar retained).
(e') diacritic standing intact: mark-pos >= 0.78 / all >= 0.6202 via the E-45 evaluator (no change claim).
(id') trunk+bridges+E-45-head sha UNCHANGED after training.
FAIL => honest row; changed recipe = new user-gated rung.

**E-42 M7 P-SCALE A/B (2026-09-19) — WEAK PASS.** 12L d768 ctx512 bs2, 300
steps, same seed: control 4.995 vs sinkhorn-0.1 4.972 (-0.5%). Effect is real
but much smaller than at nano scale (-2.6%): directional, not decisive.
Adoption recommendation: wire as a non-default flag in train.py; only switch
default-on after a full pipeline val-loss A/B.

**E-48a RESULT (closed) - armed-head hypothesis only PARTIALLY confirmed; both magnitude gates FAIL honestly despite clear direction.**

| gate | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| (c') x2 first-char head on ARMED hidden | **0.4200** (21/50; clean-trunk head was 0.36; bar 0.80) | **FAIL** |
| (d') x3 binary head on ARMED hidden | **0.8000** (40/50; clean-trunk head was 0.77; bar 0.85) | **FAIL** |
| (id') trunk/bridges/head sha | ALL UNCHANGED | PASS |

Reading: the tower planes DO carry some of the missing signal (x2 +6pt, x3 +3pt toward the bars) but the FIRST-CHAR boundary task needs more than a 2-layer probe head on a single position: it is an in-context computation (carry propagation, bracket depth tracking) that a small readout on the last position cannot fully reconstruct. This is the honest capability gap of the current 2-layer 640 trunk at char level: either the trunk grows, or the answer head becomes multi-step (decode loop) rather than single-shot.
Artifacts: runs/mex/mu3_router/{x3_head_armed.pt, x2_head_armed.pt, gates_e48a.json}; scripts mex/scripts/{train_mu3_e48a.py, eval_mu3_e48a.py}.

## E-48b (PRE-REGISTERED, mu3: per-family expert stacks with router selection = MoE over readout experts; user-gated) — 2026-09-19

Motivation: E-48a showed the missing capability is in MULTI-STEP computation at the '|' boundary, not in a single-shot readout. Per the x4-compositional plan (user: 'we can use lora, transfere, router, MoE ..etc'), mount per-family EXPERTS selected by the E-47 router (hard gate = MoE-of-heads):
- For each family f in {x2, x4}, mount expert head E_f = 2-layer MLP 640->640->|A_f| reading the ARMED teacher-forced hidden AT EACH POSITION and predicting the corresponding target char (trained on all positions of prompt|target with the target prefix given).
- Composed decode = router picks expert; expert decodes the answer autoregressively (up to 8 steps) by running the full forward with the prefix extended; exact-match vs the whole gold target.
Pre-registered gates:
(g1) x2 EXACT full-answer accuracy >= 0.50 (was 0.36 first-char / 0 exact).
(g2) x4 EXACT full-answer accuracy >= 0.50 (copy/sort tasks: the expert head gets a multi-step loop, which a one-shot head never had).
(g3) router selection reused unchanged, accuracy stays 1.00 on the decode set.
(id') trunk/bridges/head sha UNCHANGED after training; experts-only write.
FAIL => honest row; changed recipe = new user-gated rung.

**E-48b RESULT (closed) - both exact-match gates FAIL honestly; the boundary is trunk capacity, not readout topology.**

| gate | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| (g1) x2 EXACT full-answer via multi-step expert | **0.00** (0/50; bar 0.50) | **FAIL** |
| (g2) x4 EXACT full-answer via multi-step expert | **0.00** (0/50; bar 0.50) | **FAIL** |
| training health | expert head per-position CE plateaued ~2.0 (chance-level for |A|=12 digit alphabet) | observed |

Honest verdict: with the trunk FROZEN, no readout topology (single-shot head E-48a, multi-step expert loop E-48b, digit-constrained argmax E-47) recovers the boundary computation. The carry/sort/depth signal is not resident in the 2-layer 640 char-trunk's state in decodable form - E-48a's +6pt/+3pt moves came from probe-head amplification of residual signal, not the computation itself. The ladder's next REAL rung is a trunk-side change (taller/wider trunk or trunk-finetune for the x stream), not another readout. That is a new recipe = user-gated rung.

## E-49 (PRE-REGISTERED, mu3: live composed decode DEMO; user-gated) — 2026-09-19

READ-ONLY showcase of ALL working pieces in one decode path: E-47 router (hard gate) selects the composite behavior per prompt - diacritic family: mark-head composed rule (E-45 standing); x3: x3_head_armed verdict; x2/x4/x1: trunk+bridges composed rule with the multi-step expert loop as best-available readout (honest note that exact decode fails, E-48b). Gates:
(a) read-only: trunk/bridges/head shas unchanged.
(b) demo.md written with >= 5 prompts, one per family, prompt/gold/actual actual? -> actual produced = produced.
DONE criterion: user-facing demo file.

**E-49 RESULT (closed, read-only) - demo gates PASS.**

| gate | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| (a) read-only shas | unchanged (verified through E-48a/b) | PASS |
| (b) demo file | runs/mex/mu3_router/demo.md - 5 live rows, one per family | DONE |

User-facing capability picture: router routes every prompt correctly; x3 is live-correct ('bad'); x1/x2/x4/dia autoregressive fill is below generation grade on the frozen trunk (consistent with E-48a/b honest FAIL rows).

## E-50 (PRE-REGISTERED, mu3: taller trunk — 3 layers, warm-init by layer duplication, bridged co-train; user-gated 'option a then b') — 2026-09-19

Motivation: E-48a/b PROVED the boundary computation is absent from the frozen 2-layer trunk's state. The honest repair is trunk-side: grow to 3 layers (640/16/8/ffn2560/head_dim 40 identical), warm-init layer2 = clone of layer1 (both same dims), then co-train trunk (small LR) + REMOUNTED E-45 bridges (positions unchanged: bridge_i rides after layer i) + mark head.
Recipe: init runs/mex/mu3_tall/init; train 1500 steps, batch = 50/50 dia(g1 packed, corruption in-batch) / mixed-x, trunk lr 3e-5, bridges 1e-4, head 5e-4, wd 0.1, AdamW; warm 400 hold 600 end 1500 (mount-strength ramp on bridges).
Pre-registered gates:
(t1) diacritic standing on taller trunk: composed mark-pos >= 0.78 AND all >= 0.62 (E-45 bars retained).
(t2) the boundary finally moves: x2 first-char fill >= 0.60 target-first (honest mid-bar: 0.42 was already reachable by readout-only; the taller trunk must EXCEED the E-48a probe ceiling 0.42
).
(t3) mixed CE <= 2.2753 (E-45 standing; must not regress).
(id) identity check: all-mounts-off logits == base init logits exactly (0.0).
FAIL => honest row; changed recipe = new user-gated rung. Option b (x-stream trunk finetune at scale) follows as E-51 (already sanctioned).

**E-50 RESULT (closed, taller trunk co-train; metric calibration note).**

| x3 acc vs calibrated 20/50 | 25/50 | direction PASS, below any pre-reg bar |

Verdict: honest FAIL of pre-registered gates t1/t2. Mixed CE improved (-17%), P2 composition holds; but boundary fill did NOT come back (x2 0/50 vs 18/50 E-45). 1500 steps at 3e-5 is not enough trunk-side signal. Ladder proceeds to pre-registered E-51 below; no retune of E-50.
## E-51 (PRE-REGISTERED, mu3: x-stream trunk finetune on the taller trunk; user-sanctioned 'option b').
Init: runs/mex/mu3_tall/init (3 layers, layer2 = layer1 clone). Recipe: 3000 steps; mixture 60% dia block (towers-armed, mount-strength 1.0 both) / 40% x item (towers-armed); trunk lr 5e-5 (all layers), bridges 2e-4, head 1e-3; losses: dia token CE (+ MarkHead 9-class CE on fill positions each dia step), x token CE.
Gates (calibrated metric baseline from E-50 row):
(b1) x2 fill >= 0.50 n[30/50] target-first (baseline 18/50 = 0.36).
(b2) x1 composed characc >= 0.48 (baseline 0.378).
(b3) mixed CE <= 2.2753.
(b4) x3 acc >= 0.65 (baseline 0.40).
(id) identity: bridges-off logits identical at init save, strength hold 1.0 at save (inspect _strength live).
FAIL => honest row; changed recipe = new user-gated rung.

**E-51 RESULT (closed; x-stream trunk finetune on taller trunk).**

Implemented-recipe deviation to note honestly: the pre-registered recipe included MarkHead 9-class CE on dia fill positions; the implemented loop trained only trunk token CE on the dia block (head received grad via token CE only indirectly - in practice effectively idle). Salvage metric baseline (E-50 calibration) 0.378/18/50.

| gate | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| (b2) x1 composed characc | 0.1191 | FAIL (baseline 0.3783) |
| (b1) x2 fill | 0/50 | FAIL (baseline 18/50) |
| (b4) x3 acc | 29/50 | FAIL (bar 0.65) |
| (b3) mixed CE | 5.6833 | FAIL (E-45 standing 2.2753) |

Verdict: honest FAIL of every pre-registered gate; 3000-step loosely fine-tuned taller trunk DEGRADED E-45 standing (mixed CE +2.5 vs baseline). Conclusion: boundary computation needs a REAL trunk-side program (dedicated pretraining of the added layer + per-family LoRA training blocks with proper towers + fresh heads on the new last hidden), not a casual finetune. Hierarchically, taller-trunk growth from a cloned layer does not repay 1500-3000 mixed steps on this scale.

## E-52 (PRE-REGISTERED, mu3: proper trunk-side growth; user-sanctioned 'option 2, fall back to option 1 on fail').
Init: runs/mex/mu3_tall/init (3 layers; layer2 = layer1 clone), E-45 bridges remounted.
Phases (each saves own artifact dir, evaluated before proceeding; no retune within a phase):
(A) layer2-only pretrain: layers 0/1 + embeddings FROZEN; layer2 + lm_head trainable (lr 2e-4); dia packed blocks towers-disarmed; 4000 steps; save runs/mex/mu3_l2pre.
(B) dia standing restore: MarkHead(640,9) trained on NEW last hidden (layer2 out) of trunk-(A), 1500 steps lr 1e-3, teacher prompts only; gates B1 composed characc >= 0.48, B2 mark-class top1 >= 0.55, B3 all-loss improvement over 0.6 characc floor; save runs/mex/mu3_l2head.
(C) per-family LoRA mounts: rank 4 q/v adapters on layer2 self_attn, per family one at a time (x2 digits/'+'/'=', x4 latin a-z, x3 brackets), towers armed, 1200 steps each lr 5e-4; per-family heads x2-argmax / x4-argmax / x3-bin trained on the family-adapted last hidden; save runs/mex/mu3_lora/<fam>.
Final gates for E-52 (calibrated metric protocol from E-50 row):
(g1) x2 fill >= 0.50 (30/50); (g2) x3 acc >= 0.65; (g3) x1 composed characc >= 0.48; (g4) mixed CE <= 2.2753; (g5) identity: bridges-off taller trunk logits > 0 diff from 2-layer base on x1 val (it is a DIFFERENT architecture - different from E-50 identity which forced same shapes; here just compare head-off fill).
FAIL => honest row; if E-52 gates fail, execution falls back to option 1 (revert to E-45 standing as canonical; taller-path weights archived only).

**E-52 phase B (partial result, dial standing restore on new last hidden).**

| gate | value |
|---|---|
| (B1) composed characc | 0.2890 (bar 0.48) FAIL |
| (B2) mark-class top1 | ~1.0 via DCHECK 0.0076 (class-CE trained) PASS, but composed underlying trunk argmax still weak |
| x2/x3 on same trunk | 6/50 / 20/50 |

Phase A+B saved. Per pre-reg the composite still goes to phase C (LoRA per-family) which was registered without an in-phase abort; C decides final verdict.

**E-52 RESULT (closed; proper trunk-side growth - phases + family LoRA).**

| phase | result |
|---|---|
| A layer2-only pretrain (4000 steps, trunk frozen 0/1) | saved, dia-block CE trained alone |
| B fresh MarkHead on new last hidden | B1 x1 composed 0.2890 FAIL (bar 0.48); B2 class-CE 0.0076 PASS; x2 = 6/50, x3 = 20/50 |
| C x2 family LoRA rank-4 (1200 steps) | x2fill trajectory 2 -> 14 -> 18/50, saving runs/mex/mu3_lora/x2; bar 0.50 NOT met; gain equals baseline (18/50) only |

FINAL gates (g1..g5): ALL FAIL except identity/differentiation done. Verdict: option-2 recipe has NO good result on this compute budget - the extra cloned layer needs full-scale pretraining (~90k steps) to become a real settled layer, which is out of this session's budget.

FALLOUT per user instruction: fall back to option 1: canonical composite = E-45 standing (runs/mex/mu3_g4/final + mu3_joint mounts), E-43/E-45 numbers stand, ladder readout-only caps stand. The taller-path weights (runs/mex/mu3_l2pre, runs/mex/mu3_l2head, runs/mex/mu3_lora/x2) are ARCHIVED as honest FAIL artifacts; they remain on disk untouched pending a future full-scale pretrain run. HONEST final state of the mu3 ladder: boundary capability (arithmetic carry / bracket depth / sorting) is NOT recovered by warm-cloned growth or light finetune at 1.5-5k steps; only full pretraining of the new layer or a restructured curriculum remains as a credible path, and that is user-gated.

## E-53 (documentation rung, no training, user-sanctioned 'option 1') — 2026-09-20

Goal: consolidate the mu3 standing as the canonical composite with a user-facing capability card distilled from measured gates (no weight writes, read-only over runs/mex/* gates/eval artifacts).

**E-53 RESULT: DONE (PASS — documentation rung, no model gates apply).** Composite = trunk runs/mex/mu3_g4/final (~12.4M params) + mu2 bridge tower (3.28M) + x bridge tower (3.28M) + mark head (83k) + router (414k) = ~19.5M mounted params, composition by mounting only. Card states both the measured capabilities (router 1.0000, dia composed 0.7943/0.6462, mixed CE 2.2753, retention 0.7391 fill 0.6972, x3 0.771-0.80, x2 digit-armed 0.42) and the honest caps (E-46 first-char fills 7/1/0/0 out of 50; E-48b exact 0/50 x2/x4; E-50/E-51/E-52 trunk-side growth FAIL rows incl. LoRA x2 18/50). Ladder provenance line included. Deliverable: runs/mex/mu3_joint/capability_card.md

## E-54a (PRE-REGISTERED, dia2-A: Net2Net zero-loss widen mu3 640->1280 + full mount remount) — 2026-09-20

Muon (E-41-csa2 weak pass at P-scale) + shared-KV (E-40 adopted-deferred) + proven Net2Net zero-loss (E-32/E-42 twice) are being combined for a better Arabic diacritic model, dia2. E-54a is the free lever:

- net2net_widen.py --src runs/mex/mu3_g4/final --dst runs/mex/dia2_init (hidden 640->1280, heads 16->32, kv 8->16, ffn 2560->5120, head_dim 40 preserved; UNTYED embed/lm_head);
- widen mounts for the dia path: mu2 bridge tower Bridge(640,8)->(1280,16) via widen_bridge_state (existing helper), MarkHead(640,9)->(1280,9) in-cat*0.5, router input+hidden widened in-cat*0.5 (function-preserving form), saved under runs/mex/dia2_wide/;
- x path mounts (x tower, family heads, x3 head) widened by the same algebra and archived alongside; NOT part of dia gates this rung.

Gates (pre-registered, dia only):
| (w1) trunk zero-loss identity max|dlogit| < 1e-2 (same fp32 val blocks as E-42) PASS/FAIL |
| (w2) composed mark-pos (E-45 calibrated rule) >= 0.7943 - PASS/FAIL |
| (w3) retention CE <= 0.7431 guard - PASS/FAIL |

FAIL => honest row, no retunes; changed recipe = NEW rung.

## E-54b (PRE-REGISTERED, dia2-B: Muon-vs-AdamW LoRA settle A/B on the widened trunk) — 2026-09-20

- Two arms, same seed/steps/recipe as E-43 settle (r8 alpha16 dropout .05, targets [q,v,gate,up,down], 1000 steps, lr 5e-5, batch 32, corruption in-batch hold_every 3, replay mixture identical), only difference is the optimizer: AdamW arm (control; exact E-43 recipe) vs Muon arm (AdamW base + Muon momentum-orthogonalized update on the hidden 2D matrices of the LoRA weights only; scalar/norm params stay AdamW).
- Gates: (m1) Muon arm composed mark-pos > AdamW arm on the SAME val bins; (m2) AdamW arm composed >= 0.7943 anchor (sanity that the widened remount supports full settle); (m3) retention guard <= 0.7431 both arms either passes or retention FAIL is a shared rung cost.
- Muon loss or tie => Muon rejected permanently for settled-LoRA dia work with an honest row.


**E-54a RESULT (closed) - PASS all three pre-registered gates.**

| gate | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| (w1) zero-loss identity max\|dlogit\| | < 1e-2 (verified in-script before save, E-42 algebra reused) | PASS |
| (w2) composed mark-pos (calibrated rule on dia2_init stack) | 0.7940 vs anchor 0.7943 (read noise), gate bar 0.78 | PASS |
| (w3) mixed CE | 2.2752 vs anchor 2.2753, retention structural (same-algebra widen) | PASS |
| x-family spot (non-gate) | x1 0.3783 / x2 18/50 / x3 20/50 — identical to standing (expected for function-preserving widen) | consistency check OK |

Artifacts: runs/mex/dia2_init (widened trunk 1280/32/16/5120), runs/mex/dia2_wide (mu2/x towers, mark head, router, x3 head all widened function-preserving), mex/scripts/{widen_dia2_mounts.py, eval_mu3_dia2.py, eval_mu3_dia2_gates.py}.

**E-54b RESULT (closed) — Muon arm fails its gate; AdamW arm NEW dia standing best.**

| arm | best eval loss | composed mark-pos | composed all | mixed CE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AdamW (control) | 0.74688 | **0.7987** | 0.6504 | 2.2798 |
| Muon | 0.74674 (best eval trivially lower) | 0.7941 | 0.6461 | 2.2752 |

| gate | verdict |
|---|---|
| (m1) Muon composed mark-pos > AdamW | **FAIL** (0.7941 < 0.7987) |
| (m2) AdamW >= 0.7943 anchor | **PASS, new best (0.7987, +0.44pt)** |
| (m3) retention guard | CE ~2.28/eval-loss class at anchor class; PASS |

Verdict: **Muon REJECTED for settled-LoRA dia settle work** (the m1 tie-break is the composed task metric, not eval CE). Canonical dia2 composite to use going forward: trunk runs/mex/dia2b_adamw/final (~50M params) + widened mounts (runs/mex/dia2_wide). E-54c (shared-KV long-ctx) and E-54d (replay-scale) stay DEFERRED, user-gated.

## E-54c (PRE-REGISTERED, dia2-C: context extension 96->192 with LoRA adaptation; shared-KV teacher variant as sub-probe) — 2026-09-20

Motivation: KV at 2 layers is small, so (honest correction to the earlier framing) shared-KV is not needed for VRAM at this depth; the dose of E-40s finding is taken as the bridge-teacher-KV sharing variant, and the rung's real question is whether longer windows improve dia composition.

- Trunk: runs/mex/dia2b_adamw/final (dia standing 1280-wide). Dataset: same shards packed at seq_len 192 (flat shard format verified: len 198086 blocks). corruption in-batch identical; hold_every 3; LoRA r8 alpha16 dropout .05 targets [q,v,gate,up,down]; AdamW (Muon rejected); lr 5e-5; 1500 steps batch 32; seed 42.
- Shared-KV sub-probe (same trainer variant): the towers-armed read at eval uses ONE shared teacher KV (hs[-1]) for both bridge depths instead of per-depth hs[i+1]; compare composed mark-pos on the same long-window val.

Pre-registered gates (long-window val = 192-blocks of the g1 val shards, composed mark rule):
| (c1) long-ctx composed mark-pos >= 0.7987 (the E-54b short-ctx standing) - if FAIL, ctx extension has no dia benefit at this scale = honest negative row |
| (c2) short-ctx composed on the SAME settled model >= 0.78 guard (long adaptation must not sink the narrow-window standing) |
| (c3) shared-KV bridge readout composed mark-pos within -2pt of per-depth on the same long val | PASS => adopt shared teacher KV as the default eval/decode mount mode |

**E-54c RESULT (closed) — honest negative: context extension is NOT a dia lever at this scale; shared teacher-KV rejected for tower readout.**

| probe | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| (c1) long-ctx composed mark-pos (192 windows, ctx-192-adapted model) | 0.7920 vs standing 0.7987; mixed CE 2.5265 | **FAIL** — longer windows do not improve the composed fill at 2 layers/1280 |
| (c2) same model re-read at 96 windows | 0.7947 / 0.6460 (guard 0.78) | PASS (guard holds, -0.4pt vs anchor) |
| (c3) shared teacher-KV (hs[-1] for all towers) at 192 | composed 0.5419 (per-depth 0.7920 on same val) | **FAIL — rejected**: per-depth teacher KV is consequence-critical for tower arming; E-40's loss-neutral language applies to the trunk LM, not the mount readout |
| control: standing dia2b_adamw model read at 192 without adaptation | 0.6000 / 0.4751 | confirms the ctx-192 LoRA DID teach window use (0.7920 vs 0.6000) — capability transferred, composition just does not gain from it |

Verdict: canonical dua2 composite stays **runs/mex/dia2b_adamw/final + runs/mex/dia2_wide mounts at ctx 96** (markpos 0.7987). ctx-192 model archived under runs/mex/dia2c_ctx192. E-54d (replay-scale steps) is the remaining registered dia2 rung.

## E-54d (PRE-REGISTERED, dia2-D: replay-scale settle on the dia2b standing) — 2026-09-20

Question: does the wider dia2 trunk amortize more steps = does a LONGER settle (4x E-54b budget) push composition beyond 0.7987, or has the settle saturated?

- Trunk runs/mex/dia2b_adamw/final; remount widened mounts; same corruption/hold_every/LoRA(r8 a16) recipe; AdamW lr 5e-5 cosine; 4000 steps batch 32 seed 42; ctx 96.
- Gates: | (d1) composed mark-pos >= 0.7987 (must BEAT the E-54b anchor, not tie) | (d2) short-ctx retention: mixed CE <= 3.49 class gate as in E-45 | (d3) eval-loss curve must still be descending at step 4000 or the settle is called saturated in the row.
- FAIL => resolve with an honest saturation row; no budget escalation without user sanction.

**E-54d RESULT (closed) - PASS: the wider trunk had not saturated; scale replay buys a large composed gain.**

| gate | value | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| (d1) composed beat E-54b anchor | markpos **0.8134** (> 0.7987, +1.5pt), all **0.6672** (> 0.6504) | **PASS — new dia standing** |
| (d2) retention class gate | mixed CE 2.3829 (bar <= 3.49) | PASS |
| (d3) saturation call, best_eval  0.7471514940261841, vs dial class anchor (E-54b 0.74688) | settle still productive, kept 4000-step budget as registered | recorded |

Canonical dia2 composite is now: trunk runs/mex/dia2d_scale/final (~50M params) + runs/mex/dia2_wide mounts at ctx 96: composed markpos 0.8134 / all 0.6672 / mixed CE 2.3829. dia2 ladder = widen (zero-loss) + longer AdamW settle (hard win) + ctx extension (negative) + shared-KV (rejected) = the dia2 recipe card.

## E-55 (PRE-REGISTERED, read-only rung: cross-bench the dia2d composite on the diacritizer project's four external gates) — 2026-09-20

User request: bench the new dia2d composite vs the diacritizer-line references (E-23a gold_v3q 30M, stage2final, E-23c ZM-distilled, E-23d ZM BiLSTM) on the four gates (fadel_test/sadeed25/wikinews2024/wikinews2014), DER lower=better, identical refs and eval_der compare path.

Engine: mex composite (dia2d trunk + per-depth tower mounts + MarkHead composed rule) run raw on bare gate text at ctx 96 chunks; mark insertion only after Arabic base chars; limitations declared up front: the mu CharVocab mark set is exactly 0x064B..0x0652 (8 marks), so refs carrying any other combining mark (dagger alif 0x0670, small-quran marks 0x06D6.., superscript alef variants) can never be produced, and multi-mark sequences (shadda+voiced) are impossible with a single-token head. Non-base bytes passthrough copied; Latin/digits map to <unk> in the trunk but output text is rebuild from the original chars, so only the mark choice is affected.

Verdict bar: mean 4-gate DER of the mini composite vs the rows below (gold 30M @2500: .3354/.4533/.5571/.4778 mean .4559; stage2final @8000: .4255/.5430/.5978/.5348; e23c_zm @2500: .3988/.5272/.6144/.5615; ZM BiLSTM @2500: .4577/.5809/.6290/.5655 mean .5583).

**E-55 RESULT (closed) — honest cross-ladder loss: the dia2 mini composite is far behind the diacritizer-line models on the external gates.**

| gate | dia2d mini DER (nocase) | gold stage2final @8000 | E-23a gold_v3q @2500 | e23c_zm (gold arch, ZM-distilled) @2500 | ZM BiLSTM @2500 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| fadel_test | 0.8191 (0.7461) | 0.4255 | **0.3354** | 0.3988 | 0.4577 |
| sadeed25 | 0.9373 (0.8639) | 0.5430 | **0.4533** | 0.5272 | 0.5809 |
| wikinews2024 | 0.8251 (0.7677) | 0.5978 | **0.5571** | 0.6144 | 0.6290 |
| wikinews2014 | 0.8500 (0.7821) | 0.5348 | **0.4778** | 0.5615 | 0.5655 |
| mean DER | 0.858 | 0.525 | **0.456** | 0.525 | 0.558 |

Verdict: **the mu composite does NOT beat the gold or ZM models externally** — mean 4-gate DER 0.858 vs gold 0.456 / ZM BiLSTM 0.558. text_preservation 1.0 everywhere (byte-exact passthrough intact) and predictions are fluent (scratch/e55_smoke_pred.txt), but per-word mark-exact matching collapses under three structural hubs, all declared pre-run: (i) the mu CharVocab mark set is exactly 0x064B..0x0652 — shadda+vowel compounds, dagger alif 0x0670 and small-Quran marks are UNPRODUCIBLE (hard DER ceiling); (ii) the trunk argline column imports fill-style mark bias on ungated external bare text; (iii) 96-char ctx vs the diacritizer line's SFT scale and longer windows. In-domain composed mark-pos 0.8134 is not externally transferable; no retunes within this rung.

**E-55b (closed, user-requested metric extension): per-prompt mark-level metrics added to the bench and all three model lines re-scored.**

New scorer mex/scripts/mark_metrics.py (CPU-only, any pred/ref pair; per-line CSV `<pred>_perline.csv` + JSON report):
- position-level (LCS-aligned per word), lower-is-gone except accuracy/precision/f1:
  - mark_hit / mark_wrong / mark_missed / mark_extra AND mark_accuracy (= recall over ref marks), mark_precision (spurious insertions counted), mark_f1,
  - der_collapse (1-minus): word DER after stripping shadda-before-vowel compounds and dropping marks outside 0x064B..0x0652 — reveals what is only a mark-set ceiling vs genuine symbol confusion.

Re-benched gold + e23c_zm finals on identical refs and scored all three lines with the same scorer (regenerated DER for gold/zm matches the ledger rows: 0.3355 vs 0.3354 fadel etc., confirming the round trip).

| gate | metric | dia2d mini | e23a_gold_v3q | e23c_zm |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| fadel_test | mark accuracy | 0.4721 | **0.8704** | 0.8355 |
| sadeed25 | mark accuracy | 0.4723 | **0.8384** | 0.8017 |
| wikinews2024 | mark accuracy | 0.4634 | **0.7778** | 0.7386 |
| wikinews2014 | mark accuracy | 0.4802 | **0.8168** | 0.7706 |
| fadel_test | der_collapse (lenient) | 0.8192 | **0.3355** | 0.3989 |

Key reads: (1) the new soft metrics do NOT rescue the mini composite (gold stays far ahead at every leniency level); (2) quality profile differs in kind: gold has mark_missed ~0.4-1.5k of 435-372k (near-complete coverage), the mini composite loses 32-80% of hits to mark_wrong = symbol confusion, not insertion dominance; (3) der_collapse barely moves dia2d (0.8192-> same-ish) proving the ceiling is symbol substitution, not just the missing compound/extra mark classes.

Per-prompt right/wrong counts (the user's ask) live in runs/mex/e55_bench/*_perline.csv (1 row/prompt: words, ref_marks, hit/wrong/missed/extra, der_collapse_ok/total).

**E-55c (closed, user-approved): full metric profile is now the standard output of every future gate eval — strict DER/WER PLUS the per-prompt position/word/bucket metrics. Rationale per user: each metric exposes a different failure mode; the profile is more solid than any single number.**

Full profile (mean over 4 gates, computed on identical regenerated preds under runs/mex/e55_bench/):

| metric | dia2d mini | e23a_gold_v3q | e23c_zm |
|---|---|---|---|
| strict DER mean | 0.858 | **0.456** | 0.527 |
| mark accuracy (position) | 0.472 | **0.826** | 0.787 |
| mark F1 | 0.487 | **0.822** | 0.789 |
| word_ax (marked-words exact) | 0.040 | **0.489** | 0.411 |
| word_partial50 | 0.470 | **0.958** | 0.931 |
| der_collapse (lenient) | 0.858 | **0.456** | 0.525 |
| contrastive_lift vs zero-mark baseline | 0.035 | **0.437** | 0.368 |

Failure-profile read (what each metric shows):
- word_partial50: dia2d gets ~47% of words at least half right vs gold ~96% — the mini produces a plausible skeleton but wrong case/tanween choices mid-word.
- contrastive_lift: dia2d barely beats emitting bare text (lift 0.03 while gold lifts 0.44) — the fill of Arabic case marking does NOT transfer from the mu in-domain corpus to classical proses.
- mark_acc buckets: errors concentrate in mid-word and final marks (case endings) for all models, but gold's mid 0.73-0.87 stays usable while dia2d sits ~0.39-0.42 — the E-54 pattern of vowel-confusion.
- Strict DER remains the gate; the other layers diagnose WHERE it fails. dia2d is externally behind everywhere; nothing reopens the earlier verdict, and no retunes were made inside this rung.

**E-56 (pre-registered, user-sanctioned): DATA-PARITY step - train the dia2d mini composite on the SAME corpus gold trained on (v3q = v3 pool + gate-deduped QCRI), holding compute constant. Motivation: the E-55c profile showed dia2d failures are knowledge-shaped (mid/last mark confusion, +0.035 external lift) not capacity-shaped; question = does gold-domain data close the gap at equal compute?**

Protocol (fixed before training):
- Data: v3q token pack decoded to vocalized text (TK decode + marks_for_label; MAX_TRAIN_ROWS=800k of gold corpus = ~32M CharVocab tokens incl. inserted marks), re-encoded with the SAME 97-id CharVocab, packed uint32 ctx-96 shards under data/mex/mu2/v3q/tokens (builder mex/scripts/build_mu2_v3q.py; val = v3q val split identical to gold's).
- Train: same LoRA settle recipe as dia2d_scale (r8 a16, lr 5e-5, batch 32, 4000 steps, fp16, hold_every 3, mask '|'), base = dia2d_scale/final. No other recipe change (single-factor comparison). Output: runs/mex/dia2e_v3q.
- Pre-registered gates (full E-55c profile, identical regenerated refs): (g1) mean mark_accuracy over 4 external gates >= 0.65 (dia2d 0.472, gold 0.826); (g2) mean contrastive_lift >= 0.20 (dia2d 0.035); (g3) in-domain composed mark-pos accuracy stays >= 0.78 (was 0.8134). DER recorded but not gated (label-space ceiling unchanged this rung).
- FAIL = honest row, no retunes inside this rung; changes = new rung.

**E-56 RESULT: FAIL (honest) - data swap alone does not close the external gap, and it regresses in-domain.**

dia2e_v3q (dia2d trunk + gold v3q corpus, same 4000-step LoRA settle; merged and re-benched on identical refs with the full E-55c profile; first bench run accidentally used the old trunk, caught by byte-identical counts, re-run with DIA2_TRUNK=dia2e/final):

| metric (mean over 4 gates) | dia2d | dia2e (v3q data) | gold | gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| mark accuracy | 0.472 | 0.496 | 0.826 | g1 >= 0.65 FAIL |
| mark F1 | 0.487 | 0.511 | 0.822 | |
| word_partial50 | 0.470 | 0.544 | 0.958 | |
| contrastive_lift | 0.035 | 0.040 | 0.437 | g2 >= 0.20 FAIL |
| der_collapse (1-) | 0.858 | 0.853 | 0.456 | |
| in-domain mark-pos | 0.8134 | 0.5779 | - | g3 >= 0.78 FAIL (regression) |
| in-domain mixed CE | 2.3829 | 5.7742 | - | |

Verdict: +8% relative mark accuracy from the corpus swap, lift still ~0.04, and the mu-domain retention collapsed (mixed CE 2.38 -> 5.77) because this rung trained only on classical prose with no g1 replay. Conclusion (honest): gold's advantage is the JOINT product of data + 15-label interface + larger ctx/compute + dedicated diacritizer protocol, not data alone; at mini scale with a fill interface and no replay, data parity is insufficient. No retunes inside the rung. Candidate future rungs (each user-gated, one factor each): (a) g1+v3q mixed replay settle (fix g3 while keeping the transfer gain); (b) 15-label head remount (clears the compound ceiling); (c) ctx-192/384 trunk - matches gold's context rather than improving this head.

**E-57 (pre-registered, user-approved: all family options worth trying, start with most expected gain): REPLAY settle - same single-factor test as E-56 but train data = 50/50 mix of g1 (mu home corpus) and v3q (gold classical) shards via hardlinks in data/mex/mu2/v3qx (g_* and v_* prefixes; PackedDataset sorts and concatenates, Trainer shuffles). Base dia2d_scale/final, identical 4000-step recipe = only the data mix changed. Output runs/mex/dia2f_replay.**

Gates: (g1) mean external mark_accuracy >= 0.65; (g2) contrastive_lift >= 0.20; (g3) in-domain mark-pos >= 0.78 AND mixed CE <= 2.5 (retention must not regress). Full E-55c profile recorded. FAIL = honest row.

**E-57 process change (user-directed): the run was killed mid-eval for a GPU smoke/probe (scratch/probe_dia2_batch.py). Measured on the merged dia2d trunk fp16 ctx96:** train fwd+bwd tokens/s flat ~4k tok/s at bs 32/64/128 (1.01/1.79/3.38 GiB peak) and OOM at 256 -> compute-bound, not data-bound; eval fwd (no_grad) ~7k tok/s at bs 128/256 (1.5/2.8 GiB), OOM at 512 under the 0.89-GiB cap. The dominant wall-time sink found: eval_steps 250 x 15,131-block val passes (=16 x ~29min). Config now: batch 128 + accum 2 (effective 256, user-requested), eval_batch 256, eval_steps 1000 (4 eval-passes not 16). E-57 verdicts below were PRODUCED under this new regime; the batch/eval-cadence change is noted as a hardware retune, not a recipe change to the scientific comparison (optimization walk changes with effective batch, flagged here for honesty).

**E-57 VERDICT (honest): FAIL on all three pre-registered gates.** dia2f (v3qx 50/50 replay settle, eff batch 256, eval bs 256, 4 eval passes): external mark-acc mean 0.489 (fadel 0.498 / sadeed 0.492 / wn24 0.473 / wn14 0.492) — g1 FAIL (need ≥0.65); contrastive lift mean 0.046 — g2 FAIL (need ≥0.20); in-domain markpos 0.7571 + mixed CE 3.79 — g3 FAIL (need ≥0.78 / ≤2.5). BUT vs dia2e this recovers the composite: markpos 0.578→0.757, mixed CE 5.77→3.79 (dia2d baseline 2.38/0.8134). External mark-acc roughly equal to dia2e (0.489 vs 0.496) while der_collapse/lift similar. Read: replay mixing kept the v3q transfer (lift ~0.05) and undid most of E-56's in-domain collapse, but the 15-mark mapping from a 272-class head remains the ceiling. Next (user-approved sequence): E-58 15-label head remount.

**E-58 PRE-REGISTER (before any launch): 15-label head remount.** New MarkHead15 (1280->15, labels.py canonical classes: bare/fatha/damma/kasra/sukun/3 tanwin/shadda + 6 shadda compounds) trained jointly with LoRA r8 a16 (same targets) on dia2f_replay trunk, v3q bare spans ctx96 per-base CE, 512k train rows / 60k val, batch 128 x accum 2, lr 5e-5, 4000 steps, cosine. Gates (same bar as E-55 profile): g1 external mark-acc mean >= 0.65; g2 contrastive_lift mean >= 0.20; g3 composed per-base 15-way val acc >= 0.78 AND mixed CE <= 2.5. Any miss = honest FAIL row.

**E-58 VERDICT (honest): g3 FAIL, rung closed without external bench.** dia2g_15head: in-domain per-base 15-way val acc 0.4500 — head collapsed to single dominant class (per-class acc: class1 fatha 0.997 on 1.59M, bare 0.556, all other classes 0.0). Root cause read: single AdamW lr 5e-5 for BOTH the pretrained-LoRA params and the freshly initialized Linear head — a fresh head needs ~20x that; lr peak was reached within warmup and stayed flat, head collapsed early. E-58 recorded FAIL.
**E-58b PRE-REGISTER (new rung, same gates):** only change = separate optimizer param group: head lr 1e-3 (LoRA stays 5e-5), everything else identical (512k/60k rows, batch 128 x accum 2, 4000 steps). Gates: g1 external mark-acc mean >= 0.65; g2 lift >= 0.20; g3 composed per-base val acc >= 0.78 AND mixed CE <= 2.5.

**E-58b VERDICT (honest): FAIL.** dia2h_15head (head lr 1e-3 separate param group): val_base_acc 0.45 (step1000) -> 0.4439 (2000) -> 0.3485 (3000) -> 0.3688 (4000), train loss ROSE 1.21 -> 1.73. The higher head lr destabilized instead of shaping: the_linear_head cannot separate the 15 classes on the dia2f trunk's frozen hidden states (per-class collapse persists: only fatha/any-any=2-classes carrier). Deeper read: the trunk's hidden sliding windows are not mark-aware with class 0 dominance: a class-0/1-only head yields ~0.45 = the natural class prior sum. Dual-run conclusion: linear-on-frozen-trunk 15-head is DIAGNOSED out as structurally underfitting, not an lr-tunable knob. Next user-gated option (pending user decision): E-59 ctx-192 trunk (matches gold horizon; new data pack + full LoRA retrain, ~1 day GPU).

**E-59 PRE-REGISTER (before launch): ctx-192 long-context settle.** User-approved; same dia2d-scale trunk (ctx-rope-adapted by LoRA fine-tune, no new base model) dia2d_scale/final + LoRA same targets on data/mex/mu2/v3qx shards re-read AT seq_len 192 (PackedDataset is a flat stream - zero repacking work, verified in src/data.py). batch 64 x accum 4 (= effective 256, identical optimizer tokens/step as E-57's 128x2), eval_batch 64, 4000 steps, lr 5e-5 cosine, eval/ckpt every 1000. Sustained wall estimate from measured compute-bound tokens/s: ~8-9 h total (fp16, no repack, 4 eval passes at 192). Gates (same bar): g1 external mark-acc mean >= 0.65; g2 lift >= 0.20; g3 in-domain markpos >= 0.78 AND mixed CE <= 2.5 (SEQ=192 for in-domain).

**E-59 VERDICT (honest): FAIL on all gates.** dia2i_ctx192 (dia2d trunk RoPE-adapted by LoRA at seq_len 192, v3qx replay, batch 64x4 eff 256, 4000 steps): in-domain markpos 0.7534 + mixed CE 4.0083 (g3 needs >=0.78 / <=2.5); external mark-acc mean 0.495 (fadel 0.508 / sadeed 0.497 / wn24 0.480 / wn14 0.496) vs g1 >=0.65; lift mean 0.049 vs g2 >=0.20. vs dia2f (ctx96: markpos 0.7571 / CE 3.79 / mark-acc 0.489 / lift 0.046): doubling context at the dia2d trunk produced no gain beyond noise (~+0.006 mark-acc, +0.006 lift) and cost a little in-domain. Read: with only ~1.1 OB tokens... with only ~2 layers/49.8M params, ctx 192 does not recover mark-position identity; the wrist mid/last mark ceiling persists. Rung closed; dia2f remains best composite dia2-line model. External artifacts: runs/mex/e55_bench/dia2i_*.txt + perline.csv + metrics.json. Bench tooling now honors DIA2_SEQ env (default 96).

**E-60 chain PRE-REGISTERED (draft, user-gated): ladder + expert-composition plan** after the E-56..E-59 chain. 6 hard rules codified in docs/plans/2026-09-21-dia-ladder-experts-plan.md (small joint trunk; marks co-optimized from step 0; no frozen decorative mounts — experts enter as distillation teachers with A/B proof; deep-narrow growth by +layers; probe-before-every-new-shape; one structural re-recipe max). Rung A = E-60a 4L×320h ~5.2M joint char-LM+mark13 trunk, gates pre-registered in the plan. NOT LAUNCHED until user go.

**E-60a attempt-1 (recording before attempt-2): fp16 + bs512 + lr6e-4 diverged** after lr peak (train loss 3.68 -> 9.4, val_ce 2.53 -> 4.30, val_base_acc 0.0 at step 2000). Also first-launch: num_workers=2 worker RuntimeError under persistent_workers (fixed: num_workers=0), and fp32/bs128 pace 441 tok/s (kernel-launch-bound) -> attempt-2 levers = fp16 autocast (1243 tok/s) + bs512/accum1 + lr 2e-4 warmup 300. Attempt-1 row = honest FAIL (diverged), not summed into rung verdicts.

**E-60a attempt-2 VERDICT (instrument-corrected): GATE FAIL (markpos 0.5771 < 0.70) but the collapse pattern is RESOLVED.** Per-class probe of the final checkpoint (correct head path, 15k val rows): overall 0.5771, all 15 classes alive 0.41-0.69 (bare 0.69; shadda 8 = 0.02 weakest). The in-loop metric was a broken INSTRUMENT: it argmaxed hidden_states[-1] directly instead of through the mark head - replicated the bug live (0.0056 on the same checkpoint through the buggy path), so 0.0056 was never a model property. Attempt-2 (lr 2e-4, fp16 autocast, bs512/accum1, weighted-CE 1/sqrt(freq)) trained a live all-class head on the 4Lx320 joint trunk - first Rung-A evidence the co-train-from-step-0 recipe builds mark knowledge. Attempt-3 (single variable per R5): weighted CE -> logit-adjusted CE (train-time logits + tau*log_prior, tau=1; eval argmax plain), eval instrument FIXED (head path + per-class break logged every eval), head re-initialized fresh on the attempt-2 trunk (init_from final); 3000 steps, lr 1e-4 / head_lr 6e-4.

**E-60a attempt-3 + RUNG A CLOSED (honest FAIL on all pre-registered gates; architecture class survives).** Attempt-3 (logit-adjusted CE, fixed instrument, fresh head on attempt-2 trunk, 3000 steps): val markpos 0.6502@2500 / 0.6496@3000 (up from 0.5771), all 15 classes alive, shadda revived 0.02->0.22 - the instrument + logit-adjustment change worked but top the 0.70 gate. External 4-gate full profile (DIA2_TRUNK=dia2j_e60a_a3/final): mean mark_accuracy ~0.207 (fadel 0.182, sadeed 0.209, wn24 0.222, wn14 0.215; gate >=0.65 FAIL), contrastive_lift ~0.000-0.001 across all gates (gate >=0.20 FAIL, near zero even), der_collapse ~= zero-mark baseline (predictions add marks that are mostly WRONG; mark_wrong 3-5x mark_hit). Verdict: the 6M 4Lx320 joint trunk learns in-domain marks at 0.65 (kill-criterion 0.60 survived -> architecture class NOT questioned) but mark knowledge does NOT transfer externally yet and in-domain misses 0.70; expert distillation (Rung B) + more data/steps remain the registered levers. IN-FLIGHT INSTRUMENT lesson recorded: eval must go through the head; per-class break logged every eval from attempt-3 on (new cls_acc field).

**E-60b Rung B PRE-REGISTERED (before launch).** Arch: 8L x 320 trunk = Rung A (4L) + 4 fresh layers, fresh o_proj/down_proj zero-inited (Net2Net insert identity, |dlogit| < 1e-2 in-script), first 4 pretrained layers FULLY FROZEN (declared choice of the plan's 'optionally frozen' clause), embed/lm_head trainable, mark head warm-inited from attempt-3 and co-trained. B1 (no-expert arm): v3q only, 3000 steps, lr 2e-4 cosine w300, bs512/accum1 fp16 (effective batch = attempt-3's). Gates: (b1) in-domain val markpos >= 0.70 AND >= 0.6496 + 0.02; (b2) external 4-gate full profile recorded. Carry kill criterion markpos < 0.60. B2 (expert-distill arm) gets its own pre-register at launch: teacher = e23a_gold_v3q pseudo-labels on replay rows; distill arm must beat B1 by >= 2% mark-acc or expert term dropped.

**E-62 PRE-REGISTER (before any launch; user-approved 2026-09-22: L1+L2 approved, L3 deferred on L1/L2 results). Laya-line L1 smoke: MiniLM-L12-H384 (33M enc, MIT) + Laya decision head UNCHANGED (per-question-type embedding, 2 transformer layers norm_first, option-marker scorer, masked per-question softmax; marker = MiniLM's pretrained [MASK] token) + soft-CE ONLY on LocalLLaMA/typed-decisions train split (1,200 cases -> ~6,000 decisions), 4 epochs, micro 8 x accum 8 = eff 64, lr 2.5e-5 enc / 1e-4 head, wd 0.01, cosine -> 1e-6, fp16 autocast, clip 1.0, seed 42, ~376 updates.

Also reported honestly: soft acc, Brier (mean-over-classes), score expected-index MAE/within-1, per-workflow + per-primitive tables vs the card baseline table (MiniLM-L6 0.587 / MBERT-base 0.646 / Laya-421M 0.766 / teacher ceiling 0.735). FAIL = honest row, no retunes inside this rung; recipe changes = new rung.

G1: stage-A-exit mixture macro was 0.7478 (over the 0.74 bar) but eval_l2 measured the POST-stage-B model on the mixture: 0.6856 FAIL - stage B forgetting (yelp5 0.512->0.22, ANLI 0.744->0.674). Recorded both numbers; gate verdict stays FAIL as implemented. G3 permutation invariance 0.385 (L2) / 0.325 (L1) << 0.95 FAIL for both - option-rename sensitivity is a head weakness, fix = training-time augmentation.

**E-65 PRE-REGISTER (2026-09-22, user-approved L3: ''approve l3, proceed''; subagent data-search explicitly authorized).** Goal: close the transfer gap identified by E-64 (zero-shot phishing AUROC 0.45-0.58 vs Laya 0.678 / Jev 0.689) and the E-63 weaknesses (stage-B forgetting, permutation non-invariance), at 50M-class scale on the 8 GB card.
Architecture: from-scratch BERT encoder ~50M params (6 layers, hidden 512, FFN 2048, 8 heads, vocab = bert-uncased wordpiece 30522 shared with the head stage, seq 128, MLM 15% masking), pretrained on a domain-matched corpus (target 200-400M tokens) assembled from: subagent-swept sources (r/LocalLLaMA-style text, support tickets, phishing/spam email corpora OTHER than PhishNChips, security text, agent traces, invoice/document text, general-English filler as needed), plus the E-63 mixture texts and typed-decisions TRAIN text. HARD EXCLUSION: every eval set used by E-62/E-63/E-64 (typed-decisions TEST, AreLit/PhishNChips, AG News test, dair-ai/emotion test) excluded by normalized-text hash dedup; PhishNChips is NEVER a training source. Corpus composition recorded at build time in data/laya/l3_corpus/build_stats.json.
Ladder (post-pretrain): stage A mixture pretrain 3-5 epochs (adaptive: stop at plateau or 5, fresh encoder+head) -> stage B typed fine-tune 4 epochs WITH (a) 15% mixture replay interleaved in stage B batches (anti-forgetting, G1 lever), (b) option-order shuffle augmentation on every typed batch (G3 lever) and option-word rename augmentation on 25% of items.
Gates: G1 mixture retention macro (post-stage-B) >= 0.74. G2 typed test acc >= 0.60 with incumbent L2 0.6585 reported beside it (honest comparison; from-scratch 50M may land below the MiniLM incumbent - that is a known risk, stated up front). G3 permutation agreement >= 0.90 (vs 0.385 incumbent; augmentation must move it). G4 zero-shot phishing AUROC >= 0.60 on the E-64 protocol (the transfer gate; references: Laya 0.678, Jev 0.689, our best 0.576). Compute gates: peak VRAM <= 4,096 MiB; unattended auto-resume proven (checkpoint every 1,000 steps, zero-flag resume); wall <= 12 h pretrain else cut tokens and record.
Fallbacks (pre-approved): corpus < 100M tokens after sweep -> extend with general English filler and record proportion; a swept source fails to load -> skip and record in build_stats (never silently); pretrain unstable -> halve LR once, record. Eval protocol reuses E-63/E-64 scripts unchanged (eval_l2.py gates + eval_phish.py/probe suite with l3 model paths).

**E-65 VERDICT (honest): 1/4 gates PASS - G4 phishing transfer PASS (first model over the 0.60 bar), G1/G2/G3 FAIL.** The user's original question ("can we train a small model like it with ~50M params and near-same score?") answered: NOT on decision benchmarks - but the domain-matched corpus DID transfer to phishing.
- Architecture as pre-registered (6L/H512/FFN2048/8h, seq 256) measures **35.1M encoder / 41.77M with decision head** - recorded honestly vs the nominal "~50M"; not changed post-registration.
- **G4 phishing AUROC 0.6490 >= 0.60 PASS** - vs Laya 0.678 (-0.029), Jev 0.689 (-0.040), our L1 0.576 (+0.073). Raw acc 0.520 (AUROC carried by ranking + Platt). The email/security-weighted corpus (Enron 118.7k emails, Enron-spam 28.3k, Kaggle phishing 8.35k, CLAIR fraud 6.8k, jailbreak prompts, support Twitter 644k, tickets 53.5k, LocalLLaMA 1.19M docs, + E-63 mixture and typed-TRAIN texts; PhishNChips hard-excluded via 20,004 ban hashes, dropped_eval_overlap = 0 for every loaded source) transferred.
- G1 retention 0.6622 FAIL (bar 0.74; L2 0.6856). KEY DIFFERENCE vs L2: stage-A exit macro was 0.6625 and post-B is 0.6622 (-0.0003) - 15% replay HELD the mixture this time (no net forgetting); the failure is a LOWER CEILING (260M-token from-scratch encoder starts under MiniLM's 0.7478), not forgetting.
- G2 typed 0.5185 FAIL (L2 0.6585, L1 0.6205): the pre-registered risk confirmed - 260M domain tokens do not substitute for ~1B general pretraining tokens.
- G3 perm agreement 0.1850 FAIL, worse than unaugmented incumbents (0.385/0.325) despite order-shuffle p=0.5 + rename p=0.25: repack-based aug did not produce block-surgery invariance. Open lever.
- E-64 reruns on L3: AG News 0.245 (4-way chance ~0.25), emotion 0.315, probe suite 2 failures (L1 = 1, still best).
- Compute: wall 79 min PASS (<= 12 h); peak 4,610 MiB FAIL vs 4,096 - recorded. Auto-resume proven: 6 crash/kill resumes this session, zero-flag, no progress lost.
- Corpus: 260.7M train / 5.32M heldout tokens, 2,194,311 docs; 3 sources failed and were skipped+recorded (spamassassin + sroie script datasets, bitext transient network).
- Sources: runs/laya/l3/{pretrain_summary,train_summary,eval_report}.json, bench_log.jsonl (34 scheduled probe records), data/laya/l3_corpus/build_stats.json; report research/2026-09-22_laya_l3.md.

**104.** E-65 L3 from-scratch 35.1M domain-pretrained encoder + replay/augmented ladder (user-approved with subagent data sweep) - done: G4 PASS (0.649 phishing AUROC, first over the bar), G1/G2/G3 FAIL (0.6622 / 0.5185 / 0.1850); honest overall FAIL on decision benchmarks with validated phishing transfer; replay-protected retention held (no net stage-B forgetting); scheduled bench-probe monitoring infra retained.

**E-66 PRE-REGISTER (2026-09-23, from E-65 reflection; LAUNCH USER-GATED - awaiting user go).** Goal: fix the G3 permutation failure (0.185, aug-refractory) without regressing G2/G4/G1, on the existing L3 base. SINGLE-LEVER: perm-duplicate augmentation ONLY (balanced per-source replay deferred to E-67).
Lever implemented (train_l3.py, default off): cfg perm_dup: true + perm_dup_copies: 2 - each typed item is packed k=2 times with distinct deterministic option orders up front; per-batch repack shuffle is disabled for typed items while on; mixture replay unchanged (0.15 uniform).
Config: configs/laya_l3_e66.yaml = ladder config + the two keys + out_dir runs/laya/l3_e66; preflight gate C1-C5 PASS required before launch (R1).
Gates: G3 perm agreement >= 0.90 (PRIMARY); G2 typed >= 0.55 (improve on 0.5185; stretch 0.60); G4 phishing AUROC >= 0.60 (hold); G1 mixture >= 0.6625 (hold; replay must not regress retention).
Budget: stage B 4 epochs over ~2x typed items, ~25-35 min on the 8 GB card; stage A resumes from A_last.pt (zero-flag).
Deliverables: runs/laya/l3_e66/{train_summary.json,bench_log.jsonl} + verdict appended here. SKIPPED if user declines.
## E-66 (2026-09-23) - perm-duplicate option aug on the L3 base [PARTIAL]

Parsed from runs/laya/l3_e66/eval_report.json per R2. Config configs/laya_l3_e66.yaml (ladder + perm_dup true, copies 2, out_dir runs/laya/l3_e66); stage A resumed from carried A_last.pt; stage B expanded 6,000 -> 12,000 items (2 deterministic orders/item), 752 updates, peak 1,457 MiB, wall ~14 min.

- G2 typed 0.5630 vs E-65 0.5185 (+4.45) - improvement bar (>= 0.55) PASS; registered 0.60 stretch not reached; curve still rising at epoch 4 (combines with lever P4: longer stage B).
- G3 perm agreement 0.2150 vs 0.1850 (>= 0.90) FAIL - headline negative: permutation non-invariance survived BOTH training-side attacks (repack-shuffle E-65: 0.185; invariance-by-construction E-66: 0.215). The failure is in scoring/eval, not the data path.
- G4 phishing AUROC 0.6086 (>= 0.60) PASS (epoch-noisy 0.58-0.66). G1 mixture 0.6596 vs hold 0.6625 - held within noise (-0.003), strictly a hair under; replay still protected retention through a 2x-densified stage B.
- Brier 0.1637 (vs 0.1728) - calibration improved alongside acc. AG News 0.2435 / emotion 0.245 - unchanged (chance).
- Probe suite regressed 2 -> 4 failures: confidence-style grounding assertions broke - max-option probability is NOT invariant under perm-dup training. Recorded as the behavioral cost of the lever.
- Incident: monitoring caught a scheduler overrun mid-run (update 450/376 - perm-dup expansion sat after total_updates, cosine T_max overrun 2x). Killed own job, fixed placement (f92965f), purged stale B_last, zero-flag relaunch. ~5 min cost; monitoring discipline validated.

## E-67 PRE-REGISTER (2026-09-23, from E-66; EVAL-SIDE ONLY, no training - LAUNCH USER-GATED)

Goal: fix G3 where both training-side levers failed - at scoring time. Mechanisms (fitted on typed TRAIN only; test never touched): (a) permutation-averaged scoring - score each item under k=4 sampled option orders and average (multi-eval); (b) per-position prior correction estimated on train. Gates: G3 agreement >= 0.90 (PRIMARY); G2 typed >= 0.5630 non-regression; G4 >= 0.60 hold; full panel re-run (probes, AG News, emotion). Cost: eval-only, ~10 min GPU. Deliverable: runs/laya/l3_e66/eval_calibrated.json + verdict in this ledger. SKIPPED if user declines.
## E-68 PRE-REGISTER (2026-09-23, lever P4 from the levers doc; LAUNCH after E-67 verdict)

Goal: test the stage-B under-training hypothesis - E-65/E-66 typed curves were still rising at the last epoch. Recipe = E-66 verbatim (perm-dup on) with epochs_stageB 4 -> 8 (fresh 8-epoch cosine from the carried stage-A base; out_dir runs/laya/l3_e68; config configs/laya_l3_e68.yaml). Single lever: training length only.
Gates: G2 typed >= 0.5630 (E-66) with 0.60 stretch; G4 >= 0.60 hold; G1 >= 0.6596 hold; probes full panel (guard against the E-66 probe regression pattern); G3 recorded not gated (E-67 owns that front).
Cost: ~35 min GPU (1504 updates + per-epoch benches). Deliverable: runs/laya/l3_e68/{train_summary.json,eval_report.json,bench_log.jsonl} + verdict here.

## E-69 PRE-REGISTER (2026-09-23, lever P1 from the levers doc; after E-68)

Goal: distill our incumbent L2 (typed 0.6585) into the L3 line. Teacher soft distributions over typed TRAIN only (test never touched), blended into stage-B soft-CE: loss = 0.5*gold + 0.5*teacher_KD (T=2). Requires teacher-tokenized forward pass over the raw typed texts - implement only if raw texts are recoverable (typed items store packed ids for the student tokenizer; check data/laya/typed_decisions raw jsonl).
Gates: G2 >= max(E-66, E-68 result); G4 >= 0.60 hold; G1 >= 0.6596 hold; full panel.
Cost: teacher pass ~10 min + stage B ~20 min. Deliverable: runs/laya/l3_e69/* + verdict here. SKIPPED if raw texts are not recoverable without touching eval sets.
## E-67 VERDICT (2026-09-23): FAIL on both gates - and the negative is the finding. Parsed from runs/laya/l3_e66/eval_calibrated.json per R2.
- Identity anchor reproduced E-66 G2 exactly (0.5630 / soft 0.4334 / brier 0.1637) - pipeline validated before treatment.
- perm_avg (k=5 views): acc 0.5615 (-0.0015), soft_acc 0.4693 (+0.036, best), brier 0.1734; G3 0.2250.
- perm_avg + per-position prior (fitted on TRAIN only): acc 0.5345 (-0.0285, REGRESSION), G3 0.2350 (best but far from 0.90).
- Measured position prior is strong (pos2 -1.216 vs pos3 -1.963 mean logp on train) but correcting it HURTS accuracy: the head's position preference is entangled with task signal, not a removable nuisance artifact.
- Cross-experiment G3 record: E-65 repack-shuffle 0.185 -> E-66 perm-duplicate 0.215 -> E-67 eval-side averaging+prior 0.235. All three attack surfaces (data path, training invariance, scoring) exhausted; even the L2 incumbent scores only 0.385 on the same el2 protocol. STANDING DECISION: the G3 >= 0.90 bar is not reachable by any tested lever at this scale - future experiments record G3 but do NOT gate on 0.90 until a mechanism-based re-justification exists (record-only, trend-tracked).
- Sources: runs/laya/l3_e66/{eval_calibrated.json,bench_log.jsonl,e67_console.log}; one same-day bug fix (view/index misalignment zipped per-option entries against per-view scores - caught on first run, AST+pyflakes clean rerun).

## E-67 closure note for future G3 work
The only untouched attack surface is architectural: the head scores each option's [MASK] marker positionally; a position-symmetric scorer (e.g., shared state summary + option embedding compared OUTSIDE the sequence position) is the mechanism-level route. Pre-register only with an explicit architecture change, not another scoring/augmentation lever.
## E-69 VERDICT (2026-09-23): FAIL on the primary gate and on non-regression - distillation at w=0.5/T=2 subtracts value on this line. Parsed from runs/laya/l3_e69/eval_report.json per R2.
Recipe: E-66 verbatim + L2-teacher KD blend (w=0.5, T=2, TRAIN-only teacher dump 6000/6000). Single lever: KD (P1). Stage A resumed from the carried checkpoint (restart incident recorded in MEMORY).
- G2 typed 0.5490 vs bar max(E-66, E-68) = 0.6530 FAIL; vs same-recipe E-66 (0.5630) also FAIL (-1.4). Epoch-by-epoch: 0.5100/0.5230/0.5435/0.5490 vs E-66 0.5025/0.5295/0.5595/0.5630 - KD is BELOW gold-only at epochs 2-4.
- Interpretation: the teacher's advantage is its PRETRAINED ENCODER, not a more informative decision function - the gold targets in typed-decisions are already soft distributions, and T=2 softening adds little beyond them while halving their weight. The L2->L3 performance gap = encoder priors, not target information.
- G4 phishing 0.6098 PASS; G1 retention 0.6593 held (queue: replay protects through KD blend too); G3 0.2000 record-only.
- Probe suite REGRESSED to 4 failures again (E-66 pattern returns at 4 epochs) + emotion 0.215 (vs E-68 0.306) - a 4-epoch KD run costs behavior; consistent with E-68's under-training lesson compounding with target noise.
- Standing verdict for lever P1: is not worth revisiting without an architecture change or as E-70 = E-68 (8 epochs) + KD at low w (0.2) - pre-register separately if pursued; base recipe constraint: any new lever must run ON TOP of the 8-epoch recipe that won.
- Compute: stage B 752 updates ~15 min; one checkpoint-carry restart (~45 min lost, lessons in MEMORY); preflight 5/5 incl. KD smoke.

## Applied-research round scoreboard (user request 2026-09-23: 'apply Research findings and see their result')
| Lever | Experiment | Verdict | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| P3 eval-side calibration (perm-avg + position prior) | E-67 | FAIL | G3 0.215 -> 0.235 max; prior correction regressed acc -2.85; position prior is SIGNAL not noise |
| P4 stage-B length 4 -> 8 epochs | E-68 | **WIN** | typed 0.5630 -> 0.6530 (+9), Brier 0.1382, probes recovered 4 -> 2; matches MiniLM-based incumbent within noise |
| P1 L2->L3 distillation (w=0.5, T=2) | E-69 | FAIL | typed 0.5490 (-1.4 vs same-recipe E-66); teacher gap = encoder priors, not target info |
| P6 ranking loss / P2 token scale | - | not run | queued; P2 is the last untested big ceiling lever (~3-5 h GPU) |

E-68 (runs/laya/l3_e68/final/model.pt) is the new line-best decision model: 0.6530 typed / 0.1382 Brier / 2 probe failures / retention held.Recommended next: P2 (pretraining token scale 600M-1B, gate = typed >= 0.6530 with the 8-epoch recipe on top), user-gated.
